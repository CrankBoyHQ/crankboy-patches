| HOW TO APPLY HACK |
>~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~<

1) Assuming you’re on a Windows Machine, get Lunar IPS here! http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/

2) Download Lunar IPS.

3) You need an original unmodified good dump of Pokémon Red Version & the pokéred_d_patch_v1_1.ips file to apply the patch.

4) Open Lunar IPS and Click the button “Apply IPS Patch”.

5) Read the open and change windows that pop up with their title bars to know what to do and apply the patch.

1) I stylized the font to be fancier.

	I should inform you that this might not make you pay attention to what’s being said as it’s a busy font, in time you’ll get used to it.

2) Battle HUD changed to look busier & HP Bars changed with animation.

3) I have edited the Pokémon Front Sprites using HeartGold/SoulSilver sprites from the Nintendo DS.

4) I have made the Text Boxes look fancier.

5) Minor changes to Pokédex aesthetics.

6) Compatible with your official unmodified Pokémon Red Version game saves.

7) An unintended feature, but I made the battle AIs more smarter.

It was fun working on this project. Some sprites of the Pokémon that got changed in Red look kind of unattractive. I had to resize it and that made the sprites lose their quality.

	Some Pokémon look great since I didn’t have to resize some of them. The default Pokémon Red preset palette on the Game Boy Color does wonders to the visual quality of the sprites.

It’s more official for the Pokémon to get their last form from HeartGold/SoulSilver exported to Pokémon Red.

	Many Pokémon Red sprites look horrible. I wonder why they made some Pokémon look ugly but made Pokémon such as Scyther and Jolteon look cool. Maybe their designs were in beta form.
