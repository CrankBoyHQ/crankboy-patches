To use this patch, you need the following things:

<ul>
<li>A Super Mario Land ROM
<li>HebeGB9x (for applying the patch - instructions are below)
<li>SMYGB or another Game Boy Color Emulator
</ul>

All of these can be found on PR Translations.<br><br>

Posting the patched ROM on my site is quite difficult, because the file is 1MB and it would be very annoying to have to upload it again every few days. Instead I have posted a patch, which is only a few KB. Another reason for posting a patch is that my site was deleted a while ago, and the fact that I had the ROM on my site was probably the reason. I now recommend HebeGB9x instead of SnesTool, since it is a Windows program and much easier to use. Here are some instructions for applying the patch:

<ol>
<li>Run HebeGB9x, and find the ROM file on your hard drive.
<li>Click on this file.
<li>Click 'IPS Patch ROM'.
<li>Find the patch (which is called PIKALAND.IPS) and click on it.
<li>Check the box marked 'Repair Checksum After Fix' (this is to ensure that it will work on any emulator).
<li>Click 'Patch ROM'
<li>Finally, answer yes to the question it asks (it will only invalidate the ROM if the patch is messed up, which it isn't)
</ol>

<font face="Haettenschweiler,Arial Narrow" size=6 color=FF3300>storyline <font size=5>(or lack thereof)</font></font><br><br>

Basically, this game doesn't make sense. If you really care about there being a storyline, imagine that Ash was captured by Team Rocket or something. But even that wouldn't make sense, because the only time you even come close to fighting Team Rocket is in World 4, where there are loads of Pionpi (which I've changed to Jessie). Otherwise, just play it and have fun.<br><br>

The reason why it makes no sense is because of where I've put the enemies. I have mostly just put in graphics where they would fit, and drawn my own where the Pokémon would be the right shape. Because of this, World 3 is full of Mewtwos, there are Annons all over the place and a lot Pokémon don't seem to be the right sizes compared to each other. Also, the bosses are a bit messed up. The first boss is Entei, the second is Kingdra, the third is Chansey (this is because Hiyoihoi evolved from a Tokotoko, and Chansey evolves from Blissey) and the fourth is Ho-oh. Then, the boss of the game is... a Pidgeot! I copied this graphic from Pokémon Red's SGB border, and it fits quite nicely, even if it doesn't make any sense at all! ^_^<br><br>

<font face="Haettenschweiler,Arial Narrow" size=6 color=FF3300>what's changed</font><br><br>

The point of this hack is to make an already great platform game better by making it star Pokémon! You now play Pikachu, and almost all of the enemies, items and backgrounds have been changed too. Here is what has been changed:<br><br>

<b><font color=FF3300>Latest Updates</font></b><br><br>

<ul>
<li>I've been working on this a lot, so a lot more is done. Please look below to see everything.
</ul>

<b><font color=FF3300>Text</font></b><br><br>

<ul>
<li>The title screen (Note: I might redo this some time).
<li>The font.
<li>Any text which says 'Mario'.
<li>The text when you rescue the fake princess.
</ul>

<b><font color=FF3300>Items, blocks and other similar graphics</font></b><br><br>

<ul>
<li>Mystery Block - Poké Ball
<li>Super Mushroom - Thunderstone
<li>Flower - Lightning Bolt
<li>Superball - Thundershock
<li>Star - Clear Poké Ball
<li>Coin - Lightning Coin
<li>Poison Needles - Pokénip
</ul>

A lot of backgrounds in the game have been changed to use graphics from Pokémon (for example, in World 3-1 the moai heads have been changed to trees). Some have also just been edited so that they look better, since a lot of the original Super Mario Land graphics aren't very good (for example the ceilings in World 1-3). A lot of other little things have had graphical improvements too.<br><br>

<b><font color=FF3300>Characters</font></b><br><br>

<ul>
<li>Mario - Pikachu
<li>Super Mario - Raichu
<li>Daisy Princess - Ash
<li>Sky Pop (Airplane) - Surfing Pikachu/Raichu
<li>Marine Pop (Submarine) - Flying Pikachu/Raichu
</ul>

<b><font color=FF3300>Enemies</font></b><br><br>

Note that these names (and all the item names above) are copied directly from the Super Mario Land manual. Most of the names in this game were either not translated or translated very badly. I like these names though! ^_^<br><br>

<li>Roketon - Lugia

</ul>

<font face="Haettenschweiler,Arial Narrow" size=6 color=FF3300>bugs</font><br><br>

There are a few things in the game which do not look right. Unfortunately, I have no way of fixing them at the moment. I have played through the game several times, and I know about all of these things, so please don't e-mail me about them.<br><br>

This patch is by me, Philip Reuben. My e-mail address is:<br>

You can also contact me by writing a message on the PR Translations Guestbook (which is on the PR Translations website, where you should have downloaded this patch)! In case you forgot to bookmark it, the address is:<br>

<font color=FF3300><b>Questions NOT to ask me (and their answers)</b></font>

<ul>
<li>How do I hack and translate ROMs?<br>
<i>Go to <font color=FF3300>http://fly.to/vale</font> (I can't help you more than that unless you already know the basics and you want to ask me specific questions)</i>
<li>When is the next patch coming out?<br>
<i>When I've finished it</i>
<li>Can I have the next patch now?<br>
<i>No, because I haven't finished it yet (otherwise I would have released it on my site like I always do)</i>
<li>Where can I get Pokémon Gold 100% translated?<br>
<i>Nowhere, it doesn't exist (wait for me to finish or for Nintendo to release it)</i>
</ul>

I'm getting a bit tired of being asked the same questions over and over again, so I thought I'd add that little FAQ thing in. It probably won't be very helpful to anyone (apart from the ROM hacking question), but they're the same answers I'd give you anyway. If you have more specific questions about those things feel free to ask me, but apart from that please don't bother.<br><br>

Thanks to the people who made Thingy, Relative Search, Tile Layer, SnesTool and Tabular! Without them this wouldn't be possible at all! Also, I want to thank Bung for making the GB Xchanger, because now I can test my translation on a real Game Boy Color (it works perfectly, by the way)!<br><br>
