THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: LINK'S AWAKENING/DX RESTORATION
----------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1 - 2 Dec 2009
By Artemis251 (Artemis251@yahoo.com)


VERSION HISTORY
---------------
1.1 - Apparently I used a bad ROM as a base and so distributed some bad patches
      with 1.0. This fixed those errors and made a seamless (hopefully!) patch.
      Also fixed a typo in the original game. ('Fillip'->'Flip')
1.0 - Initial release (with errors).


WHAT DOES IT...ERM...WHAT DOES IT DO?
-------------------------------------
Essentially, this minor patch reverts the changes the localization team did for
the game in order to comply with Nintendo's content standards. Alongside that,
a typo was fixed and a cave that was cut from the final game was put back into
the game. Here's a full list of the changes thus far:

1) The typo "It says, 'Tale Keyhole'" was changed back into "It says, 'Tail Keyhole'"
2) The Hippo that Schule is painting had her sprites changed back to the original
   Japanese ROM's.
3) The Necklace trade item was turned back into a swimsuit top (or as the Japanese
   version calls it, the 'Pink Brassiere'), and text was fixed to reflect this.
4) The cave originally supposed to be found by diving into a specific area in
   Kanalet's moat was created as a cave in the same area. While a diving spot would
   normally be the ideal way to find the cave, I don't know ASM hacking in order to
   properly route it to the right screen (and I doubt there's space for it without
   having to change a ton of pointers). Attempts to place a diving hole on the screen
   just results in transport to L:5's entrance.
5) Fixed the typo 'filip' to 'flip'.


HOW TO APPLY THIS PATCH
-----------------------
First note that there are two patches included. These are for the two main versions
of the game, both English-language:

Zelda4restoration_v.1.0.ips - For version 1.0 of the Link's Awakening ROM (.gb extension)
Zelda4DXrestoration_v.1.0.ips - For version 1.1 of the Link's Awakening DX ROM (.gbc extension)

You'll need an IPS patching program. The one I use is Lunar IPS; Google that and
I'm sure you'll find a download for it. Using the program is easy -- it'll just
ask you to supply the base ROM to apply the patch to, and it'll work its magic.


IN CLOSING
----------
That's about all; this was just a fun little patch for those who may not have heard
of the differences between the Japanese and English-language games. Enjoy! If you have
any comments or question (or if the patch doesn't work), send me an E-mail with the
subject 'Zelda 4 Restoration' to Artemis251@yahoo.com.
