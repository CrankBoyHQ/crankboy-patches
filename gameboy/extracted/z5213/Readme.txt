Many emulators saturate the colors of gameboy games. 
This usually isn't an issue, but something about kirby's
shade of pink looks wrong on most emulators. If you are
playing on a real Gameboy Color or using an emulator with
accurate colors, pick "BGB and OG hardware"
Otherwise, pick "Emulators with saturated color" if the 
other patch is too saturated.
