More VWF madness! as said gideon zhi :P
this isn't a translation! sorry...
is only a technical patch or better a demonstration patch.
I spent some hours (3 days) of my life on coding this (and much, much more days to
debug this patch xD), so please be kind and don't rip my work using it for your own shit!
If you would a vwf in your projects contact me at asmaster@yahoo.it.
If you use this patch as a base for your megaman xtreme hacking projects contact
me at least, and give me credit please. ^_^

If u r only a lamer do NOT even try to contact me with stupid questions like:
"i dunno asm, how can i do a vwf?" .-.
