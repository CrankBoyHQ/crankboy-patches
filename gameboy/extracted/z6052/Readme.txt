FFA Gender Swap swaps the unnamed hero's graphics with Amanda's. The NPC formerly known as Amanda is now known as "Duke" (the hero's name from related Japanese media). Pronouns for each character have been replaced (or eliminated). The amount of stress the game's script put on the hero being young did not read well after these changes (but really did it ever?) so the only character who refers to you as "girl" (in the female patches) is a villain.

In addition to gender changes some minor edits have been made to the script for typos and misspellings, but for the most part it sticks to the familiar English translation.

Some bug fixes for gameplay issues have been included. The assembly changes for these have been kept as small and targeted as possible, and are fairly well tested, but please report any issues you notice.

There are four patch variants. Choose one to apply to a clean copy of Final Fantasy Adventure.

Last but not least, thank you to Tomato for the Final Fantasy Adventure and Seiken Densetsu ROM hacking notes: https://www.romhacking.net/documents/804/

* Show the character on the naming screen.

* Allow text speedup in the second text box ("Hero was a fighter of Empire Glaive.").
* A few minor script edits for grammar.

* Bug fix: When using Nectar and Stamina you no longer need to press START or SELECT for them to take effect. (They still won't wear off until a window is shown at least 20 seconds later, so they are still exploitable.)

More still to come? To do lists only ever seem to grow, never shrink.
