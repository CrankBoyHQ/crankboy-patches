Details:



This took me quite a while to figure out and I'm sure it would have been easy for people that understand coding, but I had to learn how just by constant failures assembling the game. I will happily provide credits where credits are due so if I have not properly credited someone, please inform me and I will do my best to make sure their work is appreciated.



Hello and thank you for taking a look at this hack.

This hack consists of several manga-inspired graphic changes as well as Spaceworld '97 backsprites.

Palettes for a few Pokémon were corrected to more appropriate colors; for instance, Eevee is now brown instead of green.

Speaking of green, this hack allows you to choose a girl option based on the Green character from the manga.



- Blue's frontsprite has been updated.

- Red's frontsprite has been slightly modified, and Red's backsprite is redone.

- New modified Oak frontsprite is also featured as a post HoF battle with a team inspired by the manga.

- Mew has been added to the Pokémon Mansion.

- Almost all of the gym leaders have had slight changes to their teams (inspired by the manga).

 (with a surprise addition to Giovanni's team that won't be spoiled here)

- Team Rocket had some changes to repetitive pokemon; just replaced a few dupes with Tauros & a few Pinsir.

- Jessie & James get a Lickitung later game.

- Pikachu can learn Surf.

- New blue sprite and slightly changed dialogue for pokemon tower battle.

- Crystal Onix



Differences from Legacy98:

Legacy98 was more of a project to appeal to fans of the legacy hack by Smithplays while bringing some updated graphics. All the sprites added to that hack were originally intended for my own hack here with Pokemon Yellow 98, my own idea of a definitve pokemon yellow. it's got closer to vanilla feels with smaller changes. it adds some cut content like mew or the professor oak battle at the end (different team inspired by manga). and small changes to gym teams that make sense with the manga. hard to say but in my mind this hack is very different to legacy98 as it is a completely different experience just with updated graphics.



This hack is generally considered complete, but there are plans to continue adding more to make it the definitive way to play Pokémon Yellow.

- All spaceworld 97 Back Sprites were ripped from the redstarbluestar hack by Rangi42

- Some of the sprites were borrowed originally but were remade into something of my own. if needed to give credit of where it came from originally,

it would be Ghost-missingno. on DeviantArt.

Warning! This hack has been through VERY limited testing. let me know if anything comes up graphically that is corrupted in any way.

- Backup Saves! with each version update there is a possibility of corrupted saves. I wish it wasn't an issue but it's the only way I can continue to add cool things and fix issues. if you need anything from me, I will do my best to help.

(PKHEX Seems currently only able to change Pokémon stats/moves nothing else at the moment. and there is always risk in corruption.)
