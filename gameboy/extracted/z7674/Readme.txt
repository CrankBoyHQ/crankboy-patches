This is a complete reworking of Game Boy Tetris into an original game called “Tetris - Colossus“. This is essentially Tetris with giant blocks! Some changes have been made to accommodate those bigger blocks and it ends up being quite fun.

Skilled players will want to enable expert mode. (Press down when you hit start on the Player Select screen).

Note: The “Next Piece” preview window cannot handle displaying pieces made out of more than 3 blocks, seemingly because of a max sprites on screen issue. Fixing that would probably require some assembly work which is beyond the scope of this mod. You should still easily be able to infer which piece it is telling you is next.

This mod is for the more common 1.1 version of Gameboy Tetris.

There are 2 additional patches for converting other mods to “Tetris - Colossus”.

“Tetris - Colossus - Rosy Retrospection” is specifically for Ospin’s awesome mod. (Use this patch second, on your already patched Tetris - Rosy Retrospection.)

[Like in Threetris the ability to Pause had to be disabled because of the routine Ospin uses relative to how Start & Select work with the HOLD feature. That routine was failing during pause because it is not expecting these different piece shapes. So pause was simply disabled, which makes Hold and everything else still work perfectly. You should still be able to pause using whatever device you are playing this on, except for original hardware.

Also, like the Note above, the Next Piece preview window has max sprite issues. But since Rosy Retrospection also has the shadow piece, the Next Piece and Hold Piece windows cannot handle any more sprites at all. It is still quite easy to play.

Additionally, because of the way Rosy Retrospection calculates the score exponentially, score is basically not functional. Because it thinks these Giant blocks are worth a massive amount of points you will almost always end the round with the maximum score of 999999.]

“Tetris - Colossus - Classic Hard Drop” is specifically for Ospin’s Classic Hard Drop mod. (Use this patch second, on your already patched Tetris - Hard Drop.)
