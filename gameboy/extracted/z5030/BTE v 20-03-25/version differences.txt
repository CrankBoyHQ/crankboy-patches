quick rundown of the dif versions
apply either of these ips's based on what version of the hack you want to play

BTEvanilla: battle system left mostly the same as original unmodified crystal. battle tower mons also mostly left intact so this version is for purists


BTEkrusty: phys/spec split, tons new moves. active development, so only first 3 floors and the last one are done. check the github for updates, and exact changes for this one
