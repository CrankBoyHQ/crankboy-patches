Yes, I know the name is presumptuous, but if another level hack of DK '94 exists, I sure as heck can't find it.

======================================================

HISTORY:

I think that Game Boy Donkey Kong (also known as "Donkey Kong '94") is a decent little game, but even though a level editor for it was made back in 2014, no level hack of the game was made to go along with it, so I decided to make one in an attempt to get the ball rolling. This is a short and simple hack, only containing 4 levels (with the 5th level replaced with a "THE END" screen), so if more ambitous level hacks get released, this one will likely fall into obscurity, even among level-hack enthusiasts. I wanted to replace some of the graphics as well, but couldn't get past the compression; oh well, it's the game-play that really matters (with that said, if someone can work out the game's specific method of LZSS compression, I'd appreciate it). 

======================================================

ABOUT THIS HACK:

This is meant to be a challenge to those of you who have already beaten Donkey Kong '94, so it's likely not going to be in-line with the difficulty of the original game. With that said, it's also meant to be fair: no surprise traps or pixel-perfect timing (like those seen in kaizo hacks) will be present. There are some tricky jumps, but there's enough room for error that they're skill-based rather than luck-based.

======================================================

KNOWN BUGS:

 - Sometimes, in the fourth level, one of Mario's tiles will glitch for a few frames or so (this is most common when getting hit by a fire enemy). This doesn't affect gameplay.

 - If you select "SAVE+END" at the "THE END" screen, the rest of the game's music will be played slower until you reset the game or turn it off.

Special thanks to Bailli, without whom the DK '94 level editor (and, by extention, this hack) likely wouldn't exist. You can download the Windows build of the level editor here:

Or, if you have another operating system, you have to download all of this and build it yourself using Qt Creator:
