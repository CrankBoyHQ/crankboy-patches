Ultima - Runes of Virtue - Legend of Zelda Skin

This hack swaps the sprites for Shamino, Dupre, Iolo, and Mariah 
for Link, Lynna Knight, Linkle, and Zelda respectively 
for Ultima: Runes of Virtue. 

The character introduction blurbs have been modified to reflect
the changes. The introduction text has also been tweaked slightly
so that the setting is now "Hyrule-Brittania". You may believe
that Lord British managed to annex Hyrule to Britannia.
It is otherwise the same game as Ultima - Runes of Virtue.

The graphic change in this hack may also help players see their 
characters a little better on monochrome palettes (such as the 
original DMG palette) versus the original. The original Runes of
Virtue has several sprites use the transparency color for faces,
which causes weird graphical oddities, particularly Mariah (now Zelda).
