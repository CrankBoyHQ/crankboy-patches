The Version 1.0 release was practically Christmas Rushed, but I was wanting to "celebrate" a certain YouTuber getting to 100K subs well after this started existing to expose his actions:

PALBAL Version 2.0 is still also Christmas Rushed in interest of having this out in time for Mother's Day in hopes of doing something to honor my mom given she did at least care about me, though the Christmas Rushing here could have been worse. Please refer to my text document about the Russia-Ukraine War because I have so much to say.

Thankfully, all the important points are dealt with, so I will hope that you guys enjoy. If you need to hit me up, you should be able to find me on the Romhacking.net Discord server, providing I haven't been banned from there because the mods would listen exclusively to a tyrant of another community who wanted to arbitrarily accuse me of harassing him so that I wouldn't be able to do something like call out spite reviews against my Secret of Evermore 25th Anniversary Balance Patch.

-RoahmMythril and his fanbase for providing moral support about my parents' house, rather than accusing me of "toxic gatekeeping" or calling me "100% a troll" for wanting to spark discussion about a mid-90s SNES game having a case of the Back-To-Back trope in gameplay
