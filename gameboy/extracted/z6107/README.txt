FACEBALL 2000 DX
A Game Boy colorization hack by kkzero

v1.0 - Initial Release

This is a color/enhancement hack of the technological marvel that is Faceball 2000.

FEATURES:
-HIGHER FRAMERATES - This hack takes advantage of the GBC's extra hardware to increase the speed of gameplay.
-FULL COLOR - Multiple palettes have been utilized to add some color variety to the game.
-FIXED AUDIO - Sound channel 3 now actually gets a waveform loaded, making the music sound as intended.

Work on the hack began July 24th, 2021, with a final version being reached on August 1st, ready for release on the 2nd.

IMPORTANT: GDMA VS. NO GDMA
This hack comes in two patches--the GDMA version, and the No GDMA version.
The former uses the GBC's General DMA channel to render the 3D display faster, but has some trade-offs.
Namely, it has issues with several emulators and hardware versions, and linking two copies of this version will break the connection quickly.
Strangely, the link issue doesn't happen with one GDMA copy linking with the No GDMA version (or even the vanilla game).
(Note: Only 2-player with BGB has been tested)

GDMA VERSION COMPATIBILITY:
Emulators:
BGB - Pretty much flawless
VBA - Pretty much flawless
Sameboy - Playable, but suffers graphical artifacts on screen
mGBA - Playable, but suffers graphical artifacts on screen
Hardware:
CGB-001 - Playable, but suffers severe graphical glitchiness
AGB-001 - Playable, but suffers severe graphical glitchiness
AGS-101 - Pretty much flawless, other than the top tile row flickering
Not tested by me: AGS-001 and DOL-017
