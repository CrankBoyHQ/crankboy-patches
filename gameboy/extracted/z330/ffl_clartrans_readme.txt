Final Fantasy Legend (SaGa) (US) Clarification Translation
Skygor a.k.a. Tiro DvD
December 5, 2007
v1.00


This is a simple translation patch for FFL1 that clarifies Skills and other things.
The overall  purpose of this patch is for clarity rather than a literal translation
to preserver FFL1 style.  Again many thanks to yuandy. Words in brackets [] represent 
game icons. E.g. [Sword] for a sword icon.


Silver -> Mithrl
In older Square games Tolkien's metal Mithril is often translated as Silver. That is
why "Silver" equipment is better than "Gold" equipment. A more literal translation
with a more knowledgeable player base isn't too bad.

(Blank) [Shoes] -> Hecate [Shoes]
In both FFL and FFL2 shoes that give +10 Mana are called Kong Ming's [Shoes]. In FFL2 
it is called Hecate [Shoes], and in FFL3 there are Hecate [Shoes] that give OMute.
Name is done out of precedence and convention.

Catcraw -> Catclaw
Simple reflexive R mistranslation.

Book -> Prayer [Book]
Overiding Ninendo's censorship. Even FFL2 has a Prayer [Book].

Gaze 10 -> C-Gaze
Cursing Gaze $A8 is more apparent.

Gaze 5 -> CO-Gaze
Confusing Gaze $A9 is more apparent.

Gaze 5 -> S-Gaze
Petrifying Gaze $AD is more apparent. Very confusing with CO-Gaze that also has 5
uses. Granted a Medusæ would be more likely to have this, but that's not the point.

Gaze 5 -> D-Gaze
Deadly Gaze $AE is more apparent. Yes stoning and death lead to the same result but
not when OSton and OPara are involved.

P-Skin 20 -> PA-Skin
Paralyzing skin is more apparent.

P-Skin 25 -> PO-Skin
Poisoning skin is more apparent.

Mirror 10 -> Multply
Increasing Agility by mirror imaging is more apparent. Multiply from FFL3.

Uncurse -> Exorcis
Uncurse works like (Prayer) Book. In FFL2 it is called Dispel, but Exorcise in my
humble opinion is more apparent.

Gaze 10 -> PA-Gaze
Paralyzing Gaze $F6 is more apparent.
