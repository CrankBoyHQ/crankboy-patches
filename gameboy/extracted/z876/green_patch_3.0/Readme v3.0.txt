Pokemon GREEN Version Update v3.0

So I initially came across this mod in its earlier stages and reviewed it, stating that the only thing that it could've used was an optional patch to restore the 
English "Poke" and "Mart" signs outside of the respective PokeMARTS and PokeCenters in the overworld. Since my review the hack has been updated, but it still didn't
have the patches for the signs. Of course, I had attempted to contact those who worked on it, however they are not so easy to contact.

However, one of the team that I did manage to get in touch with told me that the overworld sprites are uncompressed, meaning that in theory it should be relatively 
simple to modify this myself with an editing program. I did some experimenting and I have been able to restore the signs myself.

Installation is simple, you pick the version of the hacks you want, then you apply the Signs patch LAST, after you've used the other patches first.

So here are the patch combinations:

Pokemon Blue > Patch With Green_full > Patch with PokeMartSigns in Green_full folder

Pokemon Blue > Patch With Green_full > Patch with Enable Blizzard > Patch with PokeMartSigns in Enable Blizzard Folder

Pokemon Blue > Patch With Green_full > Patch with Enable Flashes > Patch with PokeMartSigns in Enable Flashes folder

Pokemon Blue > Patch With Green_full > Patch with Enable Flashes & Blizzard > Patch with PokeMartSigns in Enable Flashes & Blizzard folder

Pokemon Blue > Patch With Green_full > Patch with Japanese logo + Flashes + Blizzard > Patch with PokeMartSigns in the Japanese logo + Flashes + Blizzard folder

As long as you use the PokeMartSigns patch last, everything will be fine.
