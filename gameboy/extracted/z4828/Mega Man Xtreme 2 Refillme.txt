This patch is meant to make the game a bit easier and less frustrating. Applying this patch to Mega Man Xtreme 2 will make the weapon energy of all weapons restore fully whenever a life is lost. The Mega Man games for the PS1 or later have this feature and these patches make it available for the earlier games.
