=== Patch ===

This hack updates the text of Final Fantasy Legend II (known as SaGa 2 in Japan):

	* The names for the player character races, monsters, items, magic
	spells, monster abilities, and status effects have been updated to more
	closely match the original Japanese names

	* Some names have been swapped out with better, more easily
	understandable abbreviations

	* There are no longer multiple abilities with the same name

	* In battle messages, the word "damage" is no longer plural

	* Minor changes have been made to clean up the menus

To use this patch, you will need an IPS patching program, such as Lunar IPS.
You can download Lunar IPS here: https://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/
