Super Mario Bros. Deluxe - All-Stars Edition v.1.0

This patch changes many of the game's graphics to be closer to the Super Mario All-Stars version of the game, in a similar way to the Super Mario Advance remakes' approach.

Features:
- The color schemes of Mario, Luigi and most enemies have been altered to resemble their SNES versions. All enemies except for Goombas now retain the same colors across all environments.
- Brick blocks, most environment objects and power-ups have been modified based on their Lost Levels designs, and some objects like the Question Blocks and Poison Mushrooms have been redesigned.

Installation:
Apply the patch to an unmodified US version 1.1 ROM of the game, obtained by your own means.

Changelog:
- v.1.0: Initial release.
