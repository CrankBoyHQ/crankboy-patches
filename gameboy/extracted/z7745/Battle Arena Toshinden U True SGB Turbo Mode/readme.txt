A cheat exists for Battle Arena Toshinden that is said to enable the turbo mode only possible when the game is played using a Super Game Boy. A turbo cheat does exist, except that it actually doesn't adjust the speed mode, which would require the Super Game Boy hardware, and is done only by the game itself using standard Game Boy hardware. This modification enables a "true turbo mode" that achieves the effect of using the Super Game Boy hidden mode to speed up the game to ~5.35Mhz by writing and or sending a custom command hook.
