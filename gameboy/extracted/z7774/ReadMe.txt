This is a complete reworking of Game Boy Tetris into an original game called "Tetris - Damocles". The gameplay is simple, yet quite distinct from normal Tetris.

(Also, because it only uses the D-Pad during play, this is perfect for anyone with a disability that requires them to use just one joystick and no buttons.)

What makes this so much fun, even though it is simple, is how fast it plays. The speeds are even faster than the secret "heart" expert mode in normal Game Boy Tetris!

The maximum speed (Level 9) was chosen because it is the limit of what would be playable. (Any faster and the player would not be able to reach the sides of the playfield.)

Because of that, it becomes quite tricky when B-Type garbage blocks are added. Level 5 - Height 5 has been cleared by an average player; therefore Level 6 - Height 5 is definitely beatable. Moreover, Level 9 - Height 5 is probably not winnable. Yet, Level 9 - Height 3 has been cleared.

If anyone clears Level 7 - Height 5 (or Level 9 - Height 4), please leave a Review below to let everyone know!

All game modes, even 2 player, have been tested.

This mod is for the more common 1.1 version of Game Boy Tetris.

Since the gameplay is so much different from normal Tetris, a port to Ospin's Rosy Retrospection was not required.
