Thanks for downloading the Link's Awakening Photo Guy Translation Patch!
Here's all of the changes I made, and the reasoning behind them.

A while ago, I contacted Tomato (Clyde Mandelin) through his Legends of Localization website and asked about the posters in Mabe Village's store, and he wrote an article about them. They had Japanese text that never got translated! For the full story, go here: legendsoflocalization.com/what-do-those-posters-in-links-awakening-say

All of the signs were easy enough to find in YY-CHR, though the big sign was split into four out-of-order chunks -- i.imgur.com/qw6vpXo.png
I exported the above screenshot, put the four chunks in order, edited everything in GraphicsGale, put the chunks back in the order they originally came in, and re-imported the whole thing back into YY-CHR. 

Another snippet of untranslated Japanese in the album is revealed when Link discovers the mermaid's necklace under the bridge. The photo shows that the fisherman named his boat "??," which  means "Great Catch." Everything about this snapshot is also readily available to edit in YY-CHR, but "Great Catch" was way too long a phrase to cram into such a small amount of space, no matter how I drew the letters, or which font I used in GraphicsGale's text tool. Eventually, after scouring the web for short boat names, and eventually general fishing jargon, I settled for "Zug Bug," which is a kind of bait that fishermen use to attract trout. It fits nicely in the same part of the boat in which "??" was originally written, and it feels like it could actually be an actual "funny boat name" from real life.

The other patch in this ZIP file gets rid of the "[A] Print, [B] Cancel" overlay, letting you enjoy the photos in all their glory. It also fixes something that always felt like Engrish to me. When you're viewing the photo album, the game always said:
	Select A Button.
	Cancel B Button.

Strangely, this dialogue box doesn't use the game's letter tiles. It's actually stored in the ROM as an image! I edited it in YY-CHR to make it say this instead:
	Select: A Button
	Cancel: B Button

In addition to this, the second patch changes the generic picture icons that show up when you're reading the photo album. Originally, the icons literally said "NO PRINT" and "OK." Since this menu is supposed to look like a photo album, not an in-game menu, I changed both of the graphics to actually look like Polaroid prints. For "NO PRINT," I made the icon look like a black, unexposed photo, and for "OK," I made it look like a photo that contains a bright image. 
Since a picture truly is worth a thousand words, check out Picture icon differences.bmp, an image included in this ZIP file, if you want to see exactly what this change looks like for yourself. 

I hope you enjoy these patches! Feel free to apply both of them to the same ROM.
