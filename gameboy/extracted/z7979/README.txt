The Legend of Zelda: Lunk's Awakening DX
By MajorasCask
--------------------------------------

July 30, 2023 - v1.1 - Changed thief punishment name from THIEF to EVIL!
		     - Fixed missing sword swing portrayals on sprite sheet

July 29, 2023 - v1.0 - Initial closed release

--------------------------------------

Made for DiscOrder's Evil Lunk + NPC art contest

(Evil Lunk is an inside joke name for the dark grey Lunk found in Shovel Knight: King of Cards' Tower of Joustus)

Tested on Link's Awakening DX 1.2 Revision

Features:

- Play as Evil Lunk!

- Dancer is your companion!

- That's it!

--------------------------------------

Changes to base game:

- Title screen "Link" says "Lunk" now.

- All overworld sprites of Link have been replaced with Evil Lunk.

- All overworld sprites of Marin have been replaced with Dancer.

- All text mentioning Marin has been reworked to mention Dancer instead.

--------------------------------------

Limitations:

- Only Game Boy Color support at the moment (no original Game Boy).

- Due to how palettes are implemented, Evil Lunk is light-skinned.

- Cutscenes and album photos still feature Link and Marin.

- Because of how I changed Evil Lunk's palette, the Color Dungeon exclusive  
  armor doesn't change Evil Lunk's color (you're always evil). You can still
  wear it and check what you're using in the Inventory.

- Walking to the side with the normal shield equipped looks funny.

--------------------------------------

Fun Fact:

- Marin was originally be replaced by a Beeto, but after making the sprites
  I realized a beeto didn't fit the description of an NPC.
