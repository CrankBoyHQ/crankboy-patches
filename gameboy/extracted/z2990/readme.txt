=== About this hack ===
This Patch will enhance the graphics of the Gameboy Color version of Wario Land 2:
- Fixes graphical errors on Wario and many enemies.
- Enhances Wario's colors to resemble Wario Land 3's color pattern
- Bonus: Penguin enemies now hold beer like the Japanese uncensored version! (as opposed to 'crazy balls')
- Bonus: This hack also fixes the inaccessible four 10 Gold Coins in the "Hold on to the Owl" level by changing the solid wall to breakable!

Credit goes to ShyGuyXXL for updating the graphics on Wario's portrait located in the first room of the first level!

=== ROM Info ===
I've received reports of distorted graphics in the game. In all those cases (so far) the problem was that their ROM did not match with the one that was used to build the hack upon.
Make sure the original Wario Land 2 rom matches EXACTLY with the information below:
- Database match: Wario Land II (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced) (GB Compatible)
- Database: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20180815-131105)
- File/ROM SHA-1: AE37915058035DF4CEEDD72D709F91EFB4878EFF
- File/ROM CRC32: 47BDF80
