Tetris DX didn't include a Super Game Boy palette. It is unknown why a palette wasn't included. My best guess is that Nintendo was promoting the new graphics capabilities of the Game Boy Color at the time and they deemed that adding Super Game Boy palettes would have overshadowed the Game Boy Color. While this makes sense, deciding to deliberately omit a simple matching palette for both Super Game Boy 1 and 2 borders 2 felt cheap. It bothered me enough to create one for each mode and border.

I also threw in a few bells and whistles, and included two additional patches for those using a Super Game Boy 2 setup and want to play the game with the added Super Game Boy 1 palettes and vice versa. Apply each patch to two separate original unmodified copies of Tetris DX which adds support both Super Game Boy modes.
