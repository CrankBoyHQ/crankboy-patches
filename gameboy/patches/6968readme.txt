"Tetris - Beginner" is exactly what it sounds like... Tetris for beginners! This is perfect for anyone who is perhaps showing their young kid Tetris for the first time. Or maybe for someone who just wants to relax!

Those two annoying zig-zag shapes (Z & S) that have been plaguing our Tetris games for years? GONE! To ensure that the loss of those two shapes did not make the actual gameplay less enjoyable, the frequency of the T shape has been increased. The frequency of the line shape has also been increased because, hey, this is Tetris for beginners! These changes make a perfect "easy mode" of Gameboy Tetris.

All game modes, even 2 player, have been tested.

This mod is for the more common 1.1 version of Gameboy Tetris.
