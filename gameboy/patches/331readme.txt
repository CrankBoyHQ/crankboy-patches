-- Apply the patch to the ENGLISH version of the ROM --

Notes:

This patch attempts to alter the translation of various inventories to make
things appear more consistent and easier to understand. For instance, "Mirror"
gloves become "Wizard" gloves because they enhance magic. "Mirror" doesn't seem
to indicate anything about the item's purpose. Spell names were altered to be
more in line with the Final Fantasy series, so their functions may be better
understood. For example, "Cycle" becomes an Esuna spell, because it removes
status effects. Then there were contradicting names like "Samurai" shield,
because samurai never used shields. =)

I've also added a few double-byte characters as to avoid abbreviating
everything, since the ROM had extra space. Unfortunately, I could not edit any
of the actual dialogue since it appears to be compressed or encrypted. There
were heavy amounts of inaccuracies there, which I guess we're stuck with for the
time being.

Enjoy!
