1.01 Includes fixes for some bugs reported by Xenophile (thanks for that):
* Game is not crashing anymore in the Snowfields cave
* Shutter transition effect on sprites has been disabled, improving the fade transition
* Transitioning while the main character is under the effect of Dark is not turning the screen black anymore

1.0
* Full colorization
* New world map (the old one was basically an empty space with 4 or 5 house icons)
* Some of the bugs in the original game are fixed here: after casting Heal your defense power is not reduced anymore; a moogle item can now be used to heal a moogle status.
* Inspired by the great hack made by xenophile, the sprites of the main characters are displayed in the char name selection menus.
