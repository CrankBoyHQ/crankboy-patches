1.0 (01/12/2023): Hack of Pokemon GS which adjusts the level curve.

============================

About this hack:

This hack adjusts the level curve to be more like that from Pokemon Red/Blue. In that the levels of the opponents will go from 5-65. The goal here is not necessarily to fix the issues which people have with the level curve. In fact, they likely still persist. The idea of this hack came from Flowers Blooms' musings that a 5-65 curve was considered at one point in GS' development. This is meant to be a "what if" more than a last-ditch effort to solve the problems.

Lugia and Ho-Oh have had their learn sets adjusted so that you can still have their signature moves when you get them. However, they still only have these moves in the version which they're the cover star of. You're not that off the hook!
