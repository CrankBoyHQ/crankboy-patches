This patch allows the player to walk through walls by pressing/holding down the B
button. This is a better way to walk through walls than via gameshark since
you'd always have to disable the walkthrough walls code to leave buildings to the south.
The game would crash otherwise because you'd walk into the void.

Changes in 1.1:
-Once B is no longer held, you cannot move through walls anymore.
You do not have to take another step before getting rid of the effect anymore
-You can now travers tiles occupied by people while pressing B
