When deciding which 5 block piece shapes to use in Quintris for Gameboy there were a few that would be way too complicated to use gameplay-wise. One of them, the cross shape (like a plus +), stood out in particular. This mod, called "Tetris - Cross", was an attempt to be able to actually make a fun game using that cross shape by having other, simpler, pieces compliment it and make the gameplay work. Two of the other rejected tricky "Quintris" shapes (the W and the U) are then also thrown into the mix.

It ends up being pretty interesting and fun. Though, since it is using those challenging shapes, it might be easier for some players to play it on the Rosy mod since then the "hold" piece feature could be used.

Just like in "Quintris", completing an actual Tetris (clearing 4 lines at once) is still the maximum number of lines cleared. This is because the engine is not expecting 5 lines cleared at once.

Also just like in "Quintris", the "Next Piece" preview window itself does not want to display pieces made out of more than 4 blocks… To account for this, the pieces are orientated in a way that should still allow the player to infer which one is next easily.

All game modes, even 2 player, have been tested.

This mod is for the more common 1.1 version of Gameboy Tetris.

There are 2 additional patches for converting other mods to "Tetris - Cross".

"Tetris - Cross - Rosy Retrospection" is specifically for Ospin’s awesome mod. (Use this patch second, on the already patched Tetris - Rosy Retrospection.)

[Like in "Quintris - Rosy Retrospection", the ability to Pause had to be disabled because of the routine Ospin uses relative to how Start & Select work with the HOLD feature. That routine was failing during pause because it is not expecting the Quintris piece shapes. So pause was simply disabled, which makes everything still work perfectly. You should still be able to pause using whatever device you are playing this on, except for original hardware.

Also, like for regular "Tetris - Cross", the Next Piece preview window only displays 4 squares of a piece. But in Rosy Retrospection there is a Hold piece as well... and it is only able to display three squares. The player will mostly just have to remember which piece is in Hold.]

"Tetris - Cross - Classic Hard Drop" is specifically for Ospin’s Classic Hard Drop mod. (Use this patch second, on the already patched Tetris - Hard Drop.)
