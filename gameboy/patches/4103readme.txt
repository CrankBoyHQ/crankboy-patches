			Dragon Warrior Monsters Ultimate!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This hack is essentially DWM2 NG+ for those that have played this game many times in the past and would love a new challenge. Changes have been made to the monster encounters throughout the story to provide much more variety and difficulty. Many aspects have been made more convenient to facilitate grinding for the dramatic jumps in difficulty. If you enjoy a challenging Pokemon-like experience you shoudl give it a try!

If you already have a completed save file this can offer great post-game grinding and loot. 

This is not currently compatible with the Tara version,  This may require a separate patch in the future. 
I require a save file that has just completed the story on Tara.

Use Lunar IPS to patch.

		Monsters and Gameplay			
---------------------------------------------------------
	Game now starts at Lv 5 instead of Lv 1.
	Monster stats are built using in-game stat growth tables and a custom lv 1 formula.
		This increases with each region to promote increased challenge and provide great breeding options.	
	Some monsters have utility skills they do not learn naturally. (eg. Heal, Whistle, Outside, Pheremone) 
	Custom EXP formula to ensure the challenges are worth it.
	Many monsters have had their experience requirement rank reduced.
		Out of a total 32 ranks, ultra rare monsters were reduced by 2, rare monsters were reduced by 4, and other high Exp req monsters reduced by 6. 
	Some monsters are uncatchable until they have been bred first. A list is contained with the patch.
	Base form Lord monsters can be found and recruited in some story key worlds.
	Most boss battles now have 3 enemies
	Fewer boss fights have unrecruitable monsters some of which require meat.

---------------------------------------------------------
		Breeding Changes:
---------------------------------------------------------
	For these I started with the current hack by BCRobert. From there I made some changes.
	These are BCRobert's changes. 
	Slime (Monster) x Bigroost = Wonderegg
		Slime (Family) x Watabou = Kagebou
		Slime (Family) x Warubou = Kagebou
		Dragon (Monster) x Aquahawk = Skydragon
		Vampirus x Azurile = Lamia
		Almiraj x Aquahawk = Bigroost
		Almiraj x Kitehawk = Bigroost
		Hammerman x ArmyAnt = Gohopper
		Hammerman x StagBug = Gohopper
	
	The following are my changes
		Dragon (Monster) x DarkMate = Dimensaur
		Puppetor x Devil (Family) = Sabreman
		Kitehawk x Beast (Family)= Bigroost
		Foohero x Darck = Warubou
		Warubou x Slime (Monster) = Watabou
		Blizzardy x CloudKing = Lamia
		Pheonix x CloudKing = Lamia
		ZapBird x CloudKing = Lamia
		Beastnite x PomPomBom = Copycat
		Beastnite x FoxFire = Copycat
	
---------------------------------------------------------		
		Random Key and Arena Changes
---------------------------------------------------------	
	Greatly increased odds of obtaining a higher level key.
	The Number of Random Key types has been reduced to improve the odds to ~6% for each key.
	Keys now available are the 11 Family keys, Castle (Dragon+Slime), Land (Bug+Plant), Jungle (Beast+Bird), Star (Material+Water) and Hell (Zombie+Devil)
	Odds of obtaining Family Keys increase with the level of your party leader. Lord keys have a 5% change of being found with a party leader Lv 80+
	Some monsters in random keys have had their base XP dramatically increased similar to Metaly. A list is contained with the patch.
	
	New monsters for ranks Kiddie-S.
	After beating S Rank for the first time, a large variety of tough monsters are available to challenge.
	Rewards have high odds to award TinyMedals, MeteOrbs, Seeds and Magic Keys
	Random masters have extremely high level monsters including catchable bosses!
	
---------------------------------------------------------
		Changes to Post Game
---------------------------------------------------------
	Prince Kameha and Terry now provide a difficult post-game challenge.
	Elf, Traveler and Lonely world and are extremely difficult with very desirable monsters.	
	This Brawn key obtained in game has been replaced with the Lonely Key (Typically Tara only.) 
		It can only be obtained by speaking to to the Old Man with Darck in your party. 	
		Darck can now only be recruited from the Traveler Key.		
	Milayou is the ultimate boss fight with max stats beyond 999!
	Using a cheat tool or by trading, one can obtain the Brawn, Baffle and Soul Keys. 
		These now contain tough boss challenges with a promotional event prize monster at the top. 
	
------------------------------------------------------------
		Future plans
------------------------------------------------------------
The following are incomplete or I was not able to determine how to change the necessary values.
	I couldn't change his sprite in the story sequence..
	Unable to add additional characters to the Medal Man's Rewards. You should be able to know what they are despite the missing letters.	
	Unfortunately I have not determined how to change their tile sprite on the map before the fight :S
	Changes to post-game breeding options.
