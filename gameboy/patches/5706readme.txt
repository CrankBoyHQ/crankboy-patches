 Patching a game is usually a very easy process, specially with
 IPS Patches.

 There's a variety of programs that work with IPS files, but the
 most famous one is named Lunar IPS, also called LIPS.
 
 This hack is to be patched on a Pokémon Crystal 1.1 ROM file. 
 
 More specifically, this rom:
 Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.1) [C][!].gbc
 CRC-32 : 3358E30A
 
 You open your patcher, and then point to it to the IPS
 patch and the original, unmodded ROM. It will apply it
 and inform you when it's finished, it should be quick. 
 
 Now, there's 4 Patches in total. 
 The hack comes in two varieties, Original and Alternative.
 The content changes a bit with each one. 
 Beyond that, both versions also have two varietes, 
 one being the main one, where you can't abuse Items during 
 battles or switch Pokémon after knocking an foe out, and
 one where you can do both, but with some changes should
 you choose that version and abuse those advantages. 

 CHOOSE ONLY ONE. To read all the details about the different, 
 versions check the details at the not-surprisingly-named
 "Patch Differences" section of the full Readme.
 
 And yes, the patch weights almost 75% of the original game.
