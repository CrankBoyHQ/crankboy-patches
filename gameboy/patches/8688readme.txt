Known Bugs/Errors:
-When opening the pause menu, Mega Man will slightly flicker when he is high up on the screen
-Rush Jet appears behind Mega Man due to differences in GBC sprite layering
-Some emulators occasionally draw an incorrect row of tiles during the Robot Master selection

Compatibility information:
-Should work fine on real GBC hardware
-Mainly tested using BGB and SameBoy
-Not compatible with 3DS Virtual Console injection; recommended: use Goomba Color and inject as a GBA title instead
