Pokemon Crystal: JP Changes
V1
14 JUN 2018

Back in 2011, I threw together very simple "restoration" patches for Pokemon Gold & Silver that added back in some censored art which Nintendo removed for English-speaking audiences. At least one person seemed to like what I did, and over the years I received requests to give Pokemon Crystal the same treatment (mostly from that one person).

With the advent of the Pokemon Crystal Disassembly this became a fairly easy task, so I finally drummed up the motivation and put together this patch. If you want to experience the cut Japanese content, without any of the improvements or changes that other Pokemon Crystal mods provide, this might be the ROM hack for you!

v1
------------
(Same as Gold & Silver patch)
*Returned the Beauty trainer's short-shorts, and let both her and the Swimmer (female) trainer wink again.
*Gave the Fisherman trainer his cigarette back (he was going through withdrawals).
*Let the Sage trainer pray again, and allowed the Medium trainer to hold her prayer beads again

(New to Crystal patch)
*Restored the *animated* normal and Shiny versions of Jynx to their more colorful (and controversial) appearances.

*Restored the original "quest" you had to undergo to get the Mystery Egg from the Pokemon Daycare Man - there's an extra step now!
*Partially restored the original layout for the Goldenrod City Pokemon Center and Celebi Egg quest
*Restored a missing dialogue from Ruins of Alpha researchers
*Added the "Miracle Cycle" name back to the Bike Shop

**************
Possible Future Updates?
*Add any other changed content I missed.
*Do more work on the Goldenrod City Pokemon Center to make it more functional
**************
