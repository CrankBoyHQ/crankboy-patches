Dragon Quest Monsters: Delocalized Release Notes

Dragon Quest Monsters: Delocalized is the 4th major improvement / retranslation project by the Translation Quest team. The original Dragon Warrior Monsters localization is one of the poorest done official translations in the DQ series, being rife with translation errors, having extensive spelling, grammar, and punctuation issues, phrases that didn't make any sense, a vast amount of missing humor and main-series references, as well as the typical kinds of censorship that were standard for that era. This project includes a thorough retranslation straight from the Japanese, where every line of text has been meticulously reviewed. In addition to addressing all of the problems outlined above, a great deal more personality was given to everyone from the basic NPCs to the dramatic series of archfiend encounters in post game. With those improvements, along with better formatting and improved overall flow and readability, the authors are confident that this new script will significantly enhance the experience of playing Dragon Quest Monsters.

Several other highly conservative miscellaneous fixes and improvements have been included. These include a new Dragon Quest title screen pulled directly from the German release of the game, bugfixes for incorrect experience points given by monsters in the Metal Slime group, and correction of errors to monster pixel art.

In keeping with the Delocalized moniker, this project utilizes conventions for monsters, spells, and item names that translate the Japanese namings faithfully, in keeping with the namings used in Translation Quest's DQ1-3 projects. With those extensive changes, the authors became concerned about the difficulty of players utilizing existing guides for the purpose of planning out their breeding and skill/magic acquisition. Therefore, a completely new guide using the Delocalized naming conventions has been included in the zip file for download. Previously, this information was scattered across various wiki's and faqs, but now, everything that the player needs should be present in one convenient doc.

A complete rewrite of most of the script, including...
-Delocalized conventions: Monsters, spells, and items have been renamed to be a closer approximation of the Japanese names, following the Delocalized conventions from this team's Dragon Quest NES hacks. Some compromises had to be made to accomplish this due to the game's 9-character limit for names.
-A more accurate translation with improved flow
-A multitude of spelling, grammar, and punctuation corrections
-Skill descriptions that make sense
-Restoration of all humour that was lost in translation 
		(arena jokes, king's hyperbole, casino, etc.)
-Decensored sexual references (PuffPuff, monster brothel)
-Decensored alcohol references (tavern, drunk guy)
-Decensored religious references (priests, God)
-Correction of two monsters (Kidra & MadDragon) having the same flavour text in the library
-Default player name is now cap and lowercase (Terry) as opposed to all caps (TERRY)

Bug fixes:
-Pixel fixed in the crown of GoldSlime's sprite.
-StrayMetal and MetalKing exp reward has been reversed so that MetalKing gives the most exp, in keeping with the main series DQ games.

*Note: an optional patch is included called DQM_Delocalized_Revert_Metal_XP for those players who do not want to have the Stray Metal's exp lowered and the Metal King's exp raised. If desired, it should be applied after the main patch.

Liberties:
-An NPC who was originally mistranslated as wondering if he could become a Master Monster Tamer was, in Japanese, wondering if a woman could become one. This is because the title the Master Monster Tamer has in Japanese is "Monster Jiisan" meaning similar to "Old Man Monster." We translated it as Monster Elder for a more elegant sound, and had to adapt the joke to fit the new context - we have that person now wondering if a young person can become a Monster Elder.
-One segment of dummied text was added in a relevant area, as a hint for how to obtain a rare monster - GoldSlime. This text exists in both the Japanese and English ROM, but was never used in the game.
-A bug present in the Japanese text was not corrected in the original translation. Two NPCs on the same screen give you the same line of text, resulting in some nonsense dialogue when you say "NO" to one of them. We created a new line of dialogue that makes more sense in this context.

*Wyvern comes from Dragon Quest IV, where it was originally "raibaan" in Japanese. The original intent was Wyvern, but the game has no katakana "wa", so katakana "ra", which looks fairly similar, was used instead. 
*Al-Mi'raj is a creature in Islamic mythology.
*Kamaitachi is a creature in Japanese mythology. Shortened to Kamatachi here due to 9-character limit.
*Tentsuku is a type of dance. The monster's full name would be Super Tentsuku, but that won't fit.
*Moddey, which is "mo-za" in Japanese, is a reference to the creature Moddey Dhoo in Gaelic folklore.
*Matango derives from a 1963 Japanese horror film of the same name that involves a species of mutagenic mushrooms.
*Helbockle is based on Corobockle, a creature from Japanese mythology.
*In Greek mythology, Hera transformed the nymph Iynx into a bird called a Wryneck. This monster is likely named after that myth.
*Zushioumaru is a main character in a 1954 Japanese historical film called Sansho Dayuu. The name was shortened here due to 9-character limit.
*Yatagarasu (shortened due to 9-character limit) is a reference to a three-legged crow in Japanese mythology.
*Gizmo derives from a book called War with the Gizmos by Murray Leinster.
