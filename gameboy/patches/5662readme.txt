===========================================

This is a hack of 'Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle II' for the Game Boy, to turn it into a game about OK KO, the Cartoon Network show.

I was listening to the podcast 'Retronauts', in which the OK KO creator Ian Jones-Quartey was on talking about Looney Tunes games. They pondered what would OK KO's games been like if it was released in the 90's?

So, I took some time to make that happen!
