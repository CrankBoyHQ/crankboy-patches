Features
-----------------------------------------
1. Backwards compatible color ported from the North American Yellow Version (so the game is playable on a DMG and SGB). Some palettes were altered from Yellow--specifically the MEWMON, GREYMON, LOGO1, and LOGO2 palettes.


2. Higher-res backsprites that fit with the art style of the frontsprites from this era (as they are made by Game Freak). Several backsprites were slightly cropped if a.) they had empty space at the bottom of their box, or if b.) their limbs seemed out of proportion.
	
List of backsprites that were cropped:
	-Mew
	-Gyarados
	-Oddish
	-Vileplume
	-Magneton
	-Slowpoke
	-Parasect
	-Dugtrio
	-Articuno
	-Fearow
	-Nidoking, Electabuzz, Bulbasaur, Caterpie, Cubone, Eevee, Jigglypuff, Kabuto, Weedle, Kakuna, Tentacool, Squirtle, Shellder, Psyduck, Mankey, Krabby, Poliwag, Pikachu, Paras, Omanyte, Nidoran (M), and Nidoran (F) (these ones had empty space at the bottom of their box)
	-Golbat's backsprite had its huge protruding eye toned down
	

3. A choice of patching in Japanese Blue in-game trades, wild pokemon locations, and Game Corner prize mons. The title screen from Japanese Blue is also patched in. Also (for now), all three patches add back the "Pocket Monsters" text to their games' respective Super Game Boy borders.
	
Patches (Use either: Pokemon - Red Version (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced).gb or Pokemon - Blue Version (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced).gb):
-pokered.ips (no quality of life patches)
-pokered-qol.ips
-pokered-qol-alt.ips (no alt frontsprites or change to max number of sleep turns)
-pokeblue.ips (no quality of life patches)
-pokeblue-qol.ips

-pokebluejp.ips (do not use a Japanese Blue rom--no quality of life patches)
-pokebluejp-qol.ips (do not use a Japanese Blue rom)
-pokebluejp-qol-alt.ips (do not use a Japanese Blue rom--no alt frontsprites or change to max number of sleep turns)

		
4. Some quality of life improvements were made to HM learnsets. Some mons had their HM learnsets changed to more closely match the learnsets from future generations.
	
List of Pokemon that had HMs ADDED to their learnset:
	-Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur
	-Charizard
	-Pikachu, Raichu
