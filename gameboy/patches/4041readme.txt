This patch allows the player to run and walk through walls while the B button is held down.
On top of that, it also tries to replicate the anti-crash measure that the Spaceworld 97 demos use for
their debug-mode walk through walls code.
When entering the void, which would normally crash the game, the player will simply get thrown back into the map.
