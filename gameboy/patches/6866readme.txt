V1.2

Release history:

V1.11- Fixed ramps in Black Ice Battle
V1.1 - Adjusted palettes on levels: Rattle Battle, Arctic Abyss, Black Ice Battle. Adjusted outline colors for: Clapper's Cavern, Slime Climb
V1.0 - Initial release

Features:
	-Full color GB->GBC conversion
	-(Optional) Follower Kong:  If you have an extra hit remaining, the Kong in reserve will follow you, like in the SNES games
	-(Optional) New Kiddy Mode: Kiddy Kong will also appear in barrels, functioning as an extra hit in this optional easier mode. He will always be the first hit consumed.
	 Kiddy Kong's graphics are faithfully ported from Donkey Kong Land 3. He can't kill Krunchas, though, sorry. (I tried!)
	-Patch menu to toggle optional features. Press the Select Button on the world map.
	-Sound Test: Press Select at Klubba's Kiosk to play songs from Donkey Kong Land 2, Donkey Kong Land 3, and Conker's Pocket Tales (it ran on the same sound engine, so.)
	-Rain effect added to the levels Topsail Trouble and Kreepy Krow to better match the SNES counterparts. It's custom-coded, but uses the rain graphic from Donkey Kong Land 3.
	
Known Bugs:
	-In the levels Lava Lagoon, Slime Climb, Clapper's Cavern, and Toxic Tower, the lava/slime effects flicker if the lava/slime has filled the entire screen.
	-In the levels Lava Lagoon, Slime Climb, Clapper's Cavern, and Toxic Tower, some tiles may fail to update if the lava/slime has filled the entire screen.
	 This is visual and does not impact gameplay.
	-UI window at the bottom of the screen was moved up a single pixel to fix a bug with the GBC conversion.
	
New Kiddy Mode Bugs:
	-In the beehive levels and while being blown in Windy Well, getting hit and immediately jumping to the honey wall, Kiddy Kong's sprite will remain even after death until the player changes animation.
	-Kiddy's idle animation does not fully play.
	
Hardware-Specific Errors:
	-The Donkey Kong Land games have issues with sprites not fully updating on real hardware due to how they're loaded. Recommended emulators to avoid this are: 3DS Virtual Console, VisualBoyAdvance among others.
	
Enjoy!
