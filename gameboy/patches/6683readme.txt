v1.1 - 2022-07-14 - Fixes
- Some palettes adapted to look brighter (they were adapted to GBC LCD before, but that doesn't seem to be the standard for most of the GB color hacks)
- Background at the end of stages 1-2 & 1-3 with a more colourful palette.
- Small color fixes
- Some crashes in penguin and final boss fixed
- Cart type now is MBC5+RAM+BATTERY (the same one used by the Super Mario Land DX hacks)
