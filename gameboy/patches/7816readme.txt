*UPDATE*
Please note, that I have now updated this mod, because the earlier version was made using the hack-base of oracles-disasm, which doubles the file size of the rom in order to accommodate for modding of the game. This version was made using the master branch.
*UPDATE*

This mod removes the background music in The Legend of Zelda - Oracle of Ages. Thank you to FerranArevalo from the Wind Fishes' Breeze Discord server for all the help in modifying the game's files. If it wasn't for him, this patch would not exist. This mod is compatible on both emulator and original hardware.
