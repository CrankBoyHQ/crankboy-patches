This patch enables the Boss Rush and Xtreme Mode from the start of the game, without a complete save data required. 
The patch does not change the games way of handling save data thus keeping saves compatible with the original game.

This patch is useful for speedrunners and people who do not want to complete the full game before playing the extra game modes.
