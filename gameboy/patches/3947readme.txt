Super Mario Land X
------------------
Version 1.0 - 31/03/2018

Overview
--------
Super Mario Land X is a full level hack of Super Mario Land for the Gameboy. 
It replaces all 12 levels with new layouts, bonus rooms, power-up locations and enemy locations.

The aim was to create a version of SML which still feels new and interesting to those who are very familiar with the original game.

The hack contains a 'normal' mode and a 'hard' mode. The 'normal' mode is kept to a difficulty level which is reasonably similar to the original. 
The 'hard' mode is much more difficult than the original.

This is my very first rom hack so there was a lot of learning involved in the process and therefore the levels do get somewhat more elaborate as the game goes on!

Patch Details
-------------
Two IPS patch files are included with this hack:

Super Mario Land X.ips			- the normal version of this hack which includes both a 'normal' mode and a 'hard' mode, with the 'hard' mode being triggered on completion of the game
Super Mario Land X - Hard Mode.ips	- this version enables all enemies as default so effectively both modes become 'hard' mode. This version is for those who can't be bothered to work through the normal difficulty mode.
