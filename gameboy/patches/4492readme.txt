## Poképan Crystal

A Hack for Pokémon Crystal v1.1 by Dr. Dos

This hack makes the move "Attract" work regardless of either Pokémon's gender, making all Pokémon pansexual. The move's description has been updated as well.

To play, patch your Pokemon Crystal v1.1 rom using a utility such as [Lunar IPS](https://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/) and run using any Game Boy Color emulator.

This patch has received only basic testing using a completed save. The move "Attract" is acquired via TM45 from the gym leader Whitney in Goldenrod Gym. (I am sorry that this hack does make her Miltank even more frightening.)
