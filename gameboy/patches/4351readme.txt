Final Fantasy Legend 3 "Lunacy" Hack

This ROM hack makes one simple but profound change to the game - it makes it so, every time a character levels up, he or she will transform randomly into any race that they could have been at that level.  The player must react on the fly to a party composition that fluctuates wildly not just from one dungeon to the next, but even within the current dungeon!

The transformation odds are as follows:
- 1/8 for the character's base class
- 1/4 each to become some Monster or some Beast
- 3/16 each to become some Robot or some Cyborg

Robots have some challenges in this hack since they require so much GP commitment per character to make them powerful.  To alleviate this, particularly for the early game, the following changes are also applied:

- Every character begins the game as if they had 1 capsule of each of the 4 upgrade types (HP, Attack, Defense, and Speed) already installed. This makes a level 2 Robot about as powerful as a level 2 Monster, which is hopefully enough to survive fights against the weakest enemies.

- The purchase price of robot upgrade capsules is half of what it is normally - 750GP instead of 1500GP.


And that's it.  Enjoy!

Crow!

The FFL3 shrine by Maquiladora has a nice pictoral table of boss and enemy abilities.  Particularly good for identifying when a status effect or elemental attack may be effective.

And if you enjoy this experience, why not take a look at my other project, FFIV: The Lunarian Shuffle?  FFL3 Lunacy was inspired by my play experiences with "lunacy mode" in TLS, where your party members shuffle amongst each other after every battle.
