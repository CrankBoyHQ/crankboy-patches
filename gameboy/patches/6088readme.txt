	Pokemon 251: Crystal Version (v2.3) - Razormime
=======================================================================================================

Introduction:
		Pokemon 251: Crystal Version strives for vanilla. This hack is for players who want to re-live
	the nostalgia of playing the original Pokemon Crystal, or for players who never have played the
	original, but who would like to play it for the first time. However, by playing the original base
	game on emulators, players today would be unable to complete their pokedex, or obtain any of the
	event-exclusive content like items or special pokemon. Emulator players would also be unable to
	connect to Pokemon Stadium (1 or 2) to gain access to exclusive content, or to use the GBC IR port
	to obtain exclusive mystery gift items. In addition, the rare items that generate from using the
	time capsule to trade from gen 1 to gen 2 are also unobtainable any other way. This hack provides
	players the access to every bit of that external content directly within the game itself. A lot of
	thoughtful consideration was done to ensure that the ways in which a player discovers the content
	in-game feels natural and organic, but without re-writing story or lore - this is still the story
	of the original Pokemon Crystal in its entirety. The missing content was added in a variety of
	different ways: some items may be simply found as pickups, others can be purchased from existing
	shops, others may be prizes for completing existing challenges. Howerver, some new NPC's have been
	developed, where necesarry, to further expand the ways which players will obtain content. The same
	is true for all of the missing Pokemon - Any missing pokemon which had wild locations in Gold or
	Silver have been added to those locations, any pokemon which were previously unobtainable in GSC
	but had wild locations in RBYG can now be found in those locations, some pokemon have been added to
	the wild which have never had wild locations before. All missing legendary Pokemon have encounters
	which let players battle and attempt to capture them. To make logical room for some of the missing
	content, some new areas have been developed, based on alpha or beta plans, or based on locations
	from RBYG.
	
		Please consider this crucial design choice before playing this hack: The project was also done
	in a way which allows players who wish to flash the game to real cartridges to use on real gameboy
	hardware without breaking any functionality of playing with friends via game-link cable (battling
	and trading), transfer Pokemon through time capsules, connect with the N64, or use the IR port for
	mystery gifting. Because of this, Pokemon who evolve through trading still only evolve through the
	trading mechanic. The hack does not allow players to evolve Haunter by level-up or stone - this is
	to allow the communication between gameboys to playout normally, but also so that it does not step
	on any world-breaking lore of Pokemon: "Some Pokemon evolve only by trading." The downside to this
	is that your Haunter will remain a Haunter unless you use emulators which support trading (and yes,
	there are a few), or flash them to cartridge and trade. However, to make sure players can complete
	the dex and obtain a Gengar (and other evolved Pokemon), different events have been developed to
	give players one of each of those monsters. Some are done in trades, some are gifts, and some have
	unique encounters in the same style as a legendary encounter. So please, before writing a review,
	consider that this was outlined here.
	
		The hack goes further than simply adding missing items or missing Pokemon, the hack also brings
	players content which has always been on the cartridge, but never accessible! This includes things
	like an unused NPC color and sprite, unused character emotes, and three different music tracks from
	the Mobile Adaptor functionality of the Japanese version which was never implemented anywhere else.
	
		I hope players enjoy this hack, and I encourage all players to play through without reading the
	spoiler guide. By using the Pokedex, most Pokemon can be located easily, and most guides for RBYGSC
	are still accurate - Pokemon have not been REMOVED from any area, only added, especially where they
	could be found in GSRBY. And for any other tricky Pokemon, there are clues which will tell players
	where to find them. Also, as a convenience to players, a special NPC can be found late game who can
	remind players of the location of every trade in the game, and what the trades expect and offer.
	
		One last thing, consider the emulator you play on! if your emulator has a working RTC function
	than there are no further steps you need to take - just patch the game and play! However, if you
	play on an emulator which does not keep track of time when you are not playing the game, you may
	want to patch the game with a clock reset patch. I have fully tested this patch by Drenn and can
	confirm complete compatibility: http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3948/ . To apply, first run the
	Pokemon 251 Crystal patch, and then run Drenn's patch.

=======================================================================================================
	3) Version Changes
=======================================================================================================

	First, you can continue with your old save file, but you must patch a clean base Crystal with
251 Crystal. Also, before you use your old save in the new patch, save at a Pokemon Center!
Some areas have changed, and you wouldn't want to end up inside a wall or with scripting issues.
Make sure your old save and rtc files and the new patched 251 Crystal rom all have the exact
same name (but different extensions).

	Second, as a special note to returning players, I have specifically designed all the new events and
content to be obtainable in such a way that returning players who have 100% completed every battle,
caught every pokemon, found every item, etc in the old patch, can still get all the newly added stuff!
For example, you get some special items for defeating Misty; well, just go back and talk to her!
However, any of the one-time items or Pokemon which were new to the old patch (v1.0 or v1.1) which you
have collected will NOT appear again - you cannot get Articuno or Lucky Punch a second time... but
there is one exception. Because I completely rescripted the Mew event, you will be able to catch the
same Mew again after updating to patch v2.0(+). One item which might be tricky to get is the Magikarp
Doll - You are awarded this doll when you beat the Magikarp size record. Even if you set the record
before using the new patch, you can still get the doll, you would just need to set a NEW record by
catching an even bigger Magikarp... hopefully you didn't catch the biggest one to ever exist.

New changes from v2.2 to v2.3:
	A) Pokemon and People
		+ Moved wild Totodile from Blackthorn City to Lake of Rage (made more sense)
		- Removed the v2.2 clue for Totodile.
		+ Changed PokeManiac ZACH's team on Route 44: removed Rhyhorn, added JOHTO starters so players
		  can easily register all three as seen in the Pokedex to use for searching their locations.
	
	B) Misc.
		+ Added Kanto badges to trainer card.
		+ Created a BOOSTER PACK item and side-quest so players would have an in-game reason to return
		  to Goldenrod Pokecenter after entering the Hall of Fame and trigger the GS-Ball event. This
		  makes it so players should not need to look-up how to trigger the event online. Also, as
		  incentive to complete the quest, players will register Entei and Raikou in their Pokedex as
		  being seen, and thusly, allowing them to track them easier.

Previous changes from v2.1 to v2.2:
	A) Areas
		+ Created a better spot on the Fast Ship Aqua for the stewardess to stand in.
	
	B) Items
		+ Added the BRICK PIECE, which now has a 2% chance at being held by wild Machop.
		+ Leaf and Mushroom pickups in Viridian Forest now regenerate after certain conditions are met.
	
	C) Pokemon and People
		+ Modified the stewardess dialogue on the Fast Ship Aqua.
		+ Added a character in Vermilion who gives a hint for how to find Squirtle.

Previous changes from v2.0 to v2.1:

	A) Areas
		+ Viridian Forest, Cerulean Cave and Safari Zone now have proper locations on the Poke-Gear map.
		+ Viridian Forest has been made more dense with more shade and a canopy which does not allow FLY.

	B) Misc.
		+ Minor sprite cleanup for better tiling of a certain map feature.
		+ Squashed a rare visual bug affecting a specific NPC under specific circumstances.

Previous changes from v1.1 to 2.0:

	A) Areas
		+ Ghost House now only appears at night as opposed to all day.
		+ Cerulean Cave has been greatly expanded. New layout and substantially modified wild Pokemon data.
		+ Safari Zone has been completely redone: New layout and somewhat modified wild Pokemon data.
		- Removed grass and wild Pokemon from Celadon City, returned to normal layout.
		+ Added Viridian Forest.
		+ Added Electric Porygon and Secret Base shops.
		+ Added unused GBC Mobile music to the Radio Towers (KANTO and JOHTO) and new shops.
		+ Moved a door on the Powerplant to a position that makes more sense.

	B) Items
		+ Added methods to get ALL the room Decorations. (see items above)
		+ Added methods to get the reamianing Time Capsule items I missed in v1.1 (see items above)

	C) Pokemon and People
		+ Bulbasaur moved from Celadon City to Viridian Forest.
		+ Added the 4 special Pokemon Stadium 1 & 2 pokemon.
		+ Everyone in the new shops is new, and both shops have one person added outside.
		+ Ghost Hunter added to Lavender Town to give away a Gengar Doll and add story to the house.
		+ Added an SS Aqua attendant who gives out promotional dolls depending on the voyage.
		+ Added Biker Clint to give Grimer Doll
		+ Everyone in the Viridian Forest and Viridian Forest North Gate is new.

	4) Special Thank You
=======================================================================================================

	First, Thank you for taking a chance on my rom hack. I really intended for this hack to be the best
vanilla rom hack I could make. It should appeal to players who just want the original Crystal, but 100%
doable all alone. Looking at the size of this readme it looks like it has a lot of changes, but they
are going to blend right in. I avoided adding new mechanics or new pokemon, or new methods, or new, well,
anything, really. There are a lot of wonderful hacks out there that take Crystal and give it new twists
or bring it up to date with modern features, and I would like to encourage you to try those hacks! But
this hack, 251 Crystal, is meant for a pure nostalgia trip into the original Pokemon Crystal. I hope
you enjoy the work I have done here. If you do, please leave a review on romhacking.net so that others
might be tempted to try it as well: https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6088/

If you are interested, I have done similar hacks for Blue and Yellow. You can find them from my personal
romhacking.net page, here: https://www.romhacking.net/community/6608/

I want to thank the reviewers of Crystal 251 as of today. These reviews mean a lot to me, and I really
do appreciate this feedback! I am super happy you enjoyed it, and I hope you try this new version!
	+ Arindur			(v2.3)
	+ SteRossetto		(v2.3)
	+ Incantator 		(v2.1)
	+ ThegreatBen 		(v2.0)
	+ Aizumi 			(v1.1)
	+ KevCfcNo1 		(v1.1)

I want to thank the reviewers of 151 Blue and 151 Yellow as of the time of writing this guide as well:
	+ Vomer				(151 Blue 1.2.1 + 151 Yellow 3.0)
	+ ClaudeDixon		(151 Blue 1.2.1)
	+ headfallsoff		(151 Blue 1.2.1)
	+ Pokemonfan98		(151 Blue 1.2.1)
	+ Incantator		(151 Yellow 3.0)
	+ Greenknight9000	(151 Yellow 3.0)
	+ Pudpuda 			(151 Yellow 3.0)
	+ NordicNugz 		(151 Yellow 1.2)

A super special thank you to ElfinHilon10 for helping find a TON of free space! This allowed me to add 
the new areas to v2.0 and drastically expand a couple areas which were developed in a small fashion in

	Starting with v2.0 I have been able to realize the overworld events exactly as I wanted, but was
unable to with previous versions. I was also able to add every bit of missing content that I could find 
in real meaningful, organic, natural ways. I believe my work with this hack is complete, and I will
likely only return to it if there is some bug or oversight. I have personally tested everything in my
very own playthrough to ensure that everything works properly, and have left nothing to assumption. 
If you find a bug or oversight, please contact me via romhacking.net with what you found and I will
respond.

Version History:
