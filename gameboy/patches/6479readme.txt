Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble accelerometer removal patch 1.2 by Infinest

This patch completely removes the accelerometer from the game and replaces it with the Game Boy Color's traditional controls.
Moving, or "Tilting" has been assigned to the D-Pad. The camera can now be moved by holding Select and using the D-Pad.
Popping the floor up and jumping is done by pressing the A button while on the ground. When flying, the floor can be popped up by pressing B
and you shoot by pressing A. Most other actions have been relegated to the B button because of a lack of buttons.
The mini games have also all been updated to support traditional controls. None of the tutorial screens have been edited though,
so you'll just have to give it a try.

The game has also been converted from MBC7 to MBC5 with traditional SRAM for saving.
This allows booting the game on any flash cart that supports MBC5.

Other than that, the one incorrectly flipped tile in the level select screen has been fixed and the options for the accelerometer were removed
from the options screen.
