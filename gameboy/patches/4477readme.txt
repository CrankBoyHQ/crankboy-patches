****      SUPER MARIO LAND DX     ****
****  v2.0   20/04/2022 - toruzz  ****
**************************************

WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
Super Mario Land DX is a romhack of the original Super
Mario Land for the GameBoy that turns the game into a
GameBoy Color game. It adds color and changes the
graphics to give the game a modern look.


HOW DO I APPLY THIS PATCH?
--------------------------
You have to use an IPS patching program (e.g. Lunar IPS)
on a Super Mario Land (W) (V1.0) ROM. Please make sure it's
the one with CRC32 90776841.


CHANGELOG
---------
- Framerate issues have been addressed. That includes
  issues in the original game, especially noticeable in 3-2
  (hard mode).
- Mario's sprites have been revamped. They are mostly the
  same size as the originals.
- Mario's relative position when jumping has been fixed.
  This was responsible for the weird collision issues in
  v1.0 (yeah, it wasn't the sprites).
- Luigi has been added. He has slightly different physics.
- Old graphics are now an option. Not all graphics are
  unchanged, as it mostly affects the sprites, but this
  should be good enough for people who didn't like the
  new ones.
- A shortcut to difficult mode has been added.
- New palette for Superball Mario/Luigi.
- New animation for Super Mario/Luigi when looking up.
- New animation for Super Mario/Luigi when entering a pipe.
- Options menu added to accomodate the new options.
- Battery added to permanently save your options, top score
  and level selection.
- Every single stage's colors have been tweaked.
- An incompatibility screen for the original Game Boy has
  been added.
- Hundreds of minor (and not so minor) changes and fixes.


WHAT IF MY ROM IS V1.1?
-----------------------
It won't work.


DOES THIS WORK ON REAL HARDWARE?
--------------------------------
Yes!


I FOUND A BUG!
--------------
Please make sure this isn't present in the original game!
If you actually found one, please let me know.


SPECIAL THANKS
--------------
Martin Allen for making Land Forger. You saved me hours!
JuananBow, Dragoonglue and Marc Max for betatesting and
their valuable feedback.
