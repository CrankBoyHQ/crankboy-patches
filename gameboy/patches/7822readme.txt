This mod removes the background music in The Legend of Zelda - Oracle of Seasons. Thank you once again to FerranArevalo from the Wind Fishes' Breeze Discord server for all the help in modifying the game's files and for getting this mod to work for Seasons, when before it would just work for Ages. If it wasn't for him, neither this patch nor the Oracle of Ages - No Music patch would exist. This mod is compatible on both emulator and original hardware.
