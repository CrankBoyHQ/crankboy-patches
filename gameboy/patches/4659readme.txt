Hack Name: GBATemp Legend II

Hack of: Final Fantasy Legend II


Introduction: 

Hello everyone, Break here with the release of "GBATemp Legend II". 
Final Fantasy Legend II was the game that got me into RPGs, growing up. 
It also made me a fan of the SaGa-series...the music and the interesting stories kept me hooked. 
Over the past year or so, I have become aware of speedrunning. 
And have watched a few submissions for Final Fantasy Legend II. 
While I did learn a lot from watching these vidoes and replaying the game myself. 
I felt that it could be a bit more fun...with a few tweaks. 
So I immediately started on a quest to learn how to hack this game. 
However...with no editing tools available, 
I soon found out that I had to learn how to "Hex-Edit" 
In order to make changes to the game.  
It was a challenge to learn how to Hex-Edit, 
But luckily I ran across some very patient and friendly users 
Who had the knowledge and passion for SaGa-games 
And very very cool about helping study and learn how to tackle this game. 
After Hex-Editing and testing the gameplay a few times 
I became satisfied with what my project and am ready to share it with the world.
It sure has been a journey from January 2019 ~ August 2019 
But completed, I hope other RPG fans can enjoy this hack !
