The default movesets are modified to ensure the pokemon become significant threats. The level curve has been estimated to be smooth.\r\n\r\nWild Pokemon distribution is vastly improved, with levels fairly close to trainers. You can catch quite a variety of pokemon early on.\r\n\r\nAll trade evolutions will evolve by level up. You can purchase ethers.\r\n\r\nApart from Brock and Misty, and a couple of rival fights, all bosses will have full teams. Apart from giovanni, these will stick to their type themes with a wildcard in between.\r\n\r\nAfter koga, the trainer level curve varies a bit due to a fork in progression (such as going to silph co or seafoam islands), but the boss progression will be Giovanni, Sabrina, and Blaine.\r\n\r\nA good tip is to save rare candies, do not use them early on, as it becomes much harder to level up in the later stages. But once you beat Blaine, you can catch some very high leveled pokemon right before victory road, and you can obtain psychic types.\r\n\r\nVictory road will be the most difficult dungeon in terms of battles, as a good 95% of them will have full teams of six, and the cooltrainers will be particularly deadly, with some of the best teams in gen 1.\r\n\r\nBut if you make it past victory road, you can purchase super cheap rare candies to get to level 100. And it is essential you get to level 100, because the Elite Four will be the hardest part of the game.\r\n\r\nYou can obtain legendary pokemon, as well as a select few rare and extremely powerful pokemon in the Unknown Dungeon.\r\n\r\nOne important update is that you cannot use revives or max revives during battles, so it will take a bit more skill to handle bosses. Also, certain items have been disabled.\r\n\r\nAnother is fixing some maps and ethers are now much more affordable (but a bit more restricted).\r\n\r\nAll in all, good luck.", "reldate": "28 December 2014", "rominfo": "Country: USA\r\nMD5: 95b0fff0181590b96e8d4ab6a879d417\r\nPokemon - Blue Version (UE) [S][!]", "author": "SinisterHoodedFigure"}, "2463": {"title": "Super Mario Land 2 - MB5 Mapper Patch", "description": "Here is a patch which converts the mapper to MB5.", "reldate": "12 March 2013", "rominfo": "Super Mario Land 2 - 6 Golden Coins.gb\r\nCRC32: 635A9112\r\nMD5: 4BD6E929EC716A5C7FE7DC684860D551\r\nSHA-1: D11D94FA3C36B9F72E925070B66BB4F16D31001E\r\nSHA-256: 42045A1642F77B568534AB85B9DB93C8A33D2B95C38AE84C987F497E8D52F97F", "author": "Drakon"}, "2979": {"title": "Roll-chan World 3", "description": "This is a player sprite hack of &quot;Mega Man III&quot; for the Gameboy!\r\nThis hack changes Mega Man&#039;s player sprites and other illustrations of him into his sister Roll!", "reldate": "26 March 2017", "rominfo": "File Name:\tMegaman III (U) [!].gb\r\nFile Size:\t262,144\t\r\nCRC32:\t\t5175D761\r\nMD5:\t\t4C614F884A07872F12056AD1A421E1F9\r\nSHA1:\t\t57347305AB297DAA4332564623C4A098E6DBB1A3", "author": "Zynk Oxhyde"}, "2981": {"title": "Roll-chan World 5", "description": "This is a player sprite hack of &quot;Mega Man V&quot; for the Gameboy!\r\nThis hack changes Mega Man&#039;s player sprites and other illustrations of him into his sister Roll!", "reldate": "01 April 2017", "rominfo": "File Name:\tMegaman V (U) [S][!].gb\t\r\nFile Size:\t524,288\t\r\nCRC32:\t\t72E6D21D\r\nMD5:\t\tCEB17D831B410D91AA41BF2819CBED82\r\nSHA1:\t\t9A7DA0E4D3F49E4A0B94E85CD64E28A687D81260", "author": "Zynk Oxhyde"}, "3354": {"title": "Super Mario Land 2 DX", "description": "Super Mario Land 2 DX is a color hack for Super Mario Land 2 in the same vein as Link’s Awakening DX.

The patcher has moved on from this hack and is not interested in determining why this one fight is causing issues, so for now it is recommended that one makes use of either extremely powerful Pokémon that can near-instantly win the fight, or temporarily activates the GameShark code 0100E7CF, which causes all enemy Pokémon to start with 0 HP and instantly become knocked-out.\r\n\r\nASM Machina (a la &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot;) is a wide-scale hack designed to change a variety of aspects of Pokémon Red&#039;s gameplay, to suit the tastes of the author. A full list (read: rambling notes) of changes can be found in the Readme (called Features and Fixes.txt in the archive). However, here are some of the major ones:\r\n- Everything from the previous hack Wrap Improvements has been incorporated, and all bugs that hack had should be fixed. The full rundown is in Features and Fixes.txt, but as the name implied the hack made Trapping moves not prevent the use of attacks, but rather the use of switching out, as in later generations\r\n- The starters have been replaced by Glitch Pokémon, specifically those which are read as trainers when doing a Special Stat Encounter (since they are hard to get as a result). Their description from Oak is that glitch trainer class. Please NOTE that, although in vanilla these Pokémon learn no problematic Unterminated Name glitch moves, no guarantees can be made with all the data this hack shifted around. If any issues are discovered, please write a review about it\r\n- All wild Pokémon data have been looked over and altered to promote variety. Further, Red and Blue now have the same data, to avoid the need for trades\r\n- Because Routes 12 on down have more trainers than Cycling Road, they consequently now have higher-level Pokémon. To prevent the player from bypassing this by just going a little east from Fuchsia, Route 15 has been altered to add ledges, so that one can leave it, but not return\r\n- All learned moves have been adjusted, for a more interesting experience, and to provide strategic incentive to withhold evolving\r\n- A radical shift in combat has occurred, wherein all moves have their PP divided by 5, but a key item is given out which can heal the party between battles. In this way, PP actually circumscribe gameplay, and more thought in move selection is warranted.\r\n- Furthermore, healing items beyond potion can no longer be bought in stores, forcing a game plan beyond &quot;heal spam.&quot; To aid in this, healing moves now have a chance to miss\r\n-Enemies now have finite PP, so that the player is not put at an unfair disadvantage. When a enemy&#039;s Pokémon runs out of moves, it will of course use Struggle, but at that point they often switch out now. Sometimes, enemies will use Elixirs, so you cannot completely stall them out of the game.\r\n- The Normal type is no more, replaced by the Sound type. Thus all normal moves have had their types diversified, making for a more interesting experience. Normal-type Pokémon have had their types changed as well\r\n-To counteract this increase in effective moves, the effectiveness multiplier has been reduced, scaling by 1.5/0.7 instead of 2.0/0.5.\r\n- The old man in Viridian City has had his dialogue restored to the Japanese original, since the whole &quot;coffee&quot; thing is both infamous and nonsensical. Here the patcher is indebted to the person behind the blog [url=https://kantopia.wordpress.com/]Kantopia[/url], who graciously gave permission to use the translation posted on that site (see the Readme for the link)\r\n- Rocket grunts have had their Pokémon greatly diversified, since they have no particular theme, and they appear a great many times. Furthermore, Gym trainers have all had their rosters looked over, in order to makes things not solely one type, but rather just focused on that type. Most all other trainers have had their parties edited and somewhat diversified as well\r\n- In addition to being usable against any type, most of if not all of the bugs associated with the move Counter should be fixed\r\n- Distributed to the player upon receiving the Potion sample on Route 1 is both the above key item, and an Exp All. The Exp All is now a key item, can distribute its secondary experience to fainted Pokémon, and distributes the full XP to combatants, and then the full XP to the whole party (instead of half and half). The goal here is to make grinding less of chore; if this is undesirable, one can simply store the item in the PC\r\n- Further, because of this granting, Oak&#039;s Aide no longer rewards the player with an Exp All. Instead, the player receives the glitch item Cascadebadge, which can &quot;throw rocks&quot; and thereby increase catch rate\r\n- The bag now holds 25 items, instead of 20, to make up for the above two items taking up slots. Please note that if one wishes to do Expanded Item Pack shenanigans, this should mean that all item slots one is told to use need to have 5 added to them\r\n- The &quot;Low Health&quot; alarm sound is entirely removed, because it is extremely irritating and does not accomplish much.\r\n-You can now see how much health the enemy has numerically, albeit in a hacky way and only when they take damage or heal (so grab a notebook!).\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, thanks to the purposefully anonymous creator of the blog Kantopia, for the old man translation.\r\n\r\nThanks to Jojobear13, from whose hack shinpokered ([url]https://github.com/jojobear13/shinpokered[/url]) I got some of my finite PP code.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, the greatest gratitude is extended to the people who have disassembled Pokémon Red/Blue over at https://github.com/pret/pokered.

The goal is to enhance the original games for excellent replayability without bringing in mechanics, moves, sprites, visuals, type matchups, or Pokémon that were introduced in later games. Version 2.0 is based on the disassembly and has hundreds of new fixes/optional features!\r\n- It makes the bulk of the 151 original Pokémon all more obtainable and usable in the early game, with better movesets and more balanced stats. \r\n- Many moves in the game were rebalanced or modified. When the author says &quot;rebalanced&quot;, it means &quot;the useless things were made more useful!&quot; \r\n- There are more bug, poison, and ghost type moves available. The focus is on getting a useful set of moves available for every single Pokémon in the game. \r\n- Front sprites were updated to be just about the best set of sprites from Red/Green/Blue/Spaceworld 1997 overall.\r\n- All 151 Pokémon are obtainable in all versions of this hack. \r\n- HMs are deletable anytime you like and new code to prevent softlocks by deleting them was introduced.\r\n- Some pokemon have additional types, for example, Ninetales is now FIRE/GHOST instead of FIRE. If you don&#039;t like specific type changes, you can change any specific pokemon or all of them back to normal type-wise at an NPC in indigo plateau route 23. \r\n- Many small quality-of-life tweaks and bugfixes were made. \r\n- Game bugs that can be used to your own advantage (like the leech seed/toxic bug, the hyper beam no recharge on faint bug, etc.) are unchanged, because they are quirks of the battle engine that you can use as your own tool. \r\n- Mew is under the truck as expected!\r\n- Missingno and the item duplication glitch are intact - but won&#039;t corrupt your save anymore!\r\n- An entirely new mode for the Pokédex called the MOVEDEX was added. It shows data about moves you have seen in detail. You unlock the MOVEDEX in viridian city.\r\n- There is an arena to rematch gym leaders and other important trainers after becoming CHAMP.\r\n- There are multiple secret areas to be found after becoming CHAMP. Bills Garden, Team Rocket / Mewtwo lore, and more...\r\n- Many options to enhance the game visually and mechanically were added. **(You must turn them on via the options in-game!)** Including:\r\n- Switchable color palettes (Choose between original colors, Super Gameboy Colors, or Pokémon Yellow Colors in-game whenever you like! Works on GBC and Super Gameboy. Yes, this romhack has GBC support!)\r\n- Optional Spaceworld 1997 Back Sprites\r\n- Optional enhanced menu sprites/overworld icons\r\n- Optional enhanced music (Add in cut content music like Giovanni&#039;s theme)\r\n- Optional stereo panned audio (Similar to the Earphone1 option in Pokémon Yellow)\r\n- Optional alternate color palette Pokémon based on region (catch differently colored Pokémon depending on where they appear in Kanto)\r\n- Option to turn off the bicycle song (plays in cycling road still)\r\n- Option to turn on smoother higher framerate fade animations while on the GBC\r\n- Tweak the type matchups to be exactly like gen 1, gen 2, or a cross between them if you like directly in-game.\r\n- Optional in-battle experience bar\r\n- Option to give trainers some Stat EXP to their Pokémon based on level. Makes the game a little bit harder.\r\n- Option to have the game track the PP of opponents (the original game they had infinite PP). Makes the game a little bit easier.\r\n- If you&#039;re playing on GBC and have the palettes set to SGB or GBC mode, move animations will have colors! Surf will be blue, ember will be red, etc.\r\n- There are a couple entirely new things added into the game to facilitate quality of life fixes. Including:\r\n- An NPC who can permanently remove CUT trees.\r\n- An NPC who can revive fossils for you in SAFFRON CITY so you can get fossil Pokémon a bit earlier.\r\n- An NPC who will give you LAPRAS a bit earlier in the game.\r\n- An NPC who will teach you how to DIG in between towns just like you can FLY in between towns.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are 3 versions of this hack for Red, Blue, and Green, they only differ in title screen/intro visuals.

It is a mostly-vanilla hack that focuses on fixing game engine bugs and oversights from the original game. Additionally, trainer AI routines are improved and multiple quality-of-life enhancements have been added.

Yellow&#039;s color scheme gets converted to display on the Gameboy Color.\r\nAttack animations are colored according to type during Gameboy Color play.\r\nYellow&#039;s audio engine is backported for stereo sound support. \r\n\r\nNew options that can be toggled! Hit SELECT on the options screen to see an extra options menu.\r\n- Cycle through audio types.\r\n- Playing in GBC mode on a backlit LCD screen?\r\n  - Press SELECT at the copyright screen to activate color correction.\r\n  - Or activate it in the extra menu\r\n- Experimental 60FPS Mode\r\n- Zero-Delay Text\r\n- Hard Mode\r\n- AI Trainer Switching\r\n\r\nThe hard mode option increases difficulty by making the stats of trainer pokemon more on your level.\r\nIt also doubles the effect of the X-stat items that AI trainers are fond of.\r\nAnd it disallows the use of Revive items in battle.\r\nNon-link battles will use the Stadium 1 critical hit chance formulas.\r\nFinally, it makes catching a wild Mewtwo more challenging.\r\n\r\nTrainer AI has been improved and greatly expanded.\r\nSome trainers will even try to switch pokemon intelligently if you haven&#039;t disabled it in the extra options menu.\r\n\r\nYou get notified when a box is filled (either via catching or depositing a pokemon).\r\n\r\nSwitching out of a trapping move wastes the trapper&#039;s turn as per Pokemon Stadium.\r\nThis prevents unbeatable AI scenarios as well as a PP underflow glitch.\r\n\r\nRage is limited to 2-3 turns but attack boosts are kept.\r\nThis is primarily to prevent infinite battle loops.\r\n\r\nSleep does not prevent choosing a move, and the move is used upon waking up.\r\nTo maintain sleep move accuracy, sleep starts with a counter of at least 2.\r\nAnd Rest now sets the sleep counter to 3.  \r\n[/QUOTE]   \r\n   \r\n[B]Master features that go beyond engine modifications and fixes[/B]\r\n[QUOTE]\r\nAll 151 pkmn are available in one version including trade evolutions (rarities may vary per version).\r\n\r\nYou can play as a boy or a girl.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s an EXP bar in battle.\r\n\r\nYou can hunt for shiny pokemon, and they are valid with Gen 2 games.\r\n\r\nNo more grinding wild pokemon. Nearly all trainers can be rematched just by talking to them once or twice.\r\n\r\nYou can choose RUN while holding SELECT in trainer battles to forfeit the match and black yourself out.\r\n\r\nThere is a built-in nuzlocke mode that can be toggled from the extra options menu.\r\n\r\nThe girl in Oak&#039;s lab toggles wild pokemon randomization.\r\nIf activated early enough in the game, your starter pokemon choices are randomized as well.\r\n\r\nOne of the aides in Oak&#039;s lab toggles scaling of trainer rosters to your level (evolving them if applicable).\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to trainer scaling, there is now an obedience level-cap that can be toggled in the extra options menu.\r\nWhile active, the current maximum obedience level will display in the extra options menu.\r\nAll pokemon, not just trades, will start to disobey if over the displayed level cap.\r\n\r\nThe other aide in Oak&#039;s lab toggles a pokeball-caught symbol in battle after obtaining the pokedex.\r\nTo help with Gen 2 interaction, this also applies a gender symbol to species that can be male or female.\r\n\r\nAnother aide npc is in the Viridian pokemon center.

Yes, the ship returns!\r\n- Added some special post-game trainer battles as fun little easter eggs. Can you find and defeat all five?\r\n\r\nChanges to fishing!\r\n- All rods have an expanded level range.\r\n- The Old Rod has an expanded &#039;mon list.\r\n- The Good Rod has an expanded &#039;mon list.\r\n- The Route 12 Fishing Guru can be visited upon first reaching Lavender Town.\r\n- The locations of the Good and Super Rod have been swapped.\r\n\r\nOther minor changes to lessen annoyance.\r\n- Low HP alarm only plays three times then turns itself off.\r\n- TMs and HMs now have their move names (albeit abbreviated) appended to the item names.\r\n- All TMs can be repurchased as they are strategically scattered across all the Kanto pokemarts.\r\n- The safari zone mechanics run off level instead of speed, and safari balls have a boosted catch rate.\r\n- Slot machines are a little more lucky, so now you can actually win big.\r\n- CUT is not needed to get to Lt. Surge and Erika (a blocking event replaces the Vermilion shrub).\r\n- Yellow version learnsets have been integrated, and stone evolutions gain back some level-up moves.\r\n- Trapping moves play a &#039;poof&#039; animation on the move&#039;s final turn in order to inform the player.\r\n- A recalibrated daycare gives experience points scaled to your gym progress.\r\n- The daycare lets you select moves to forget (if any) upon retreiving your pokemon.\r\n- Retrieving a daycare pokemon that could have evolved via level will trigger evolution and learn any missed-out moves.\r\n\r\nCheats and Secrets!\r\n- A pokemon with Pay Day in your top slot might come in handy at the Game Corner.\r\n- New item, the M.GENE! Could it give low-DV pokemon a boost?\r\n- Max-out your pokemon&#039;s hidden potential with the MIST STONE.\r\n- Five post-game special trainers to find and defeat!
