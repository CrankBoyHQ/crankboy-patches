Mario Land: New GFX Edition", "description": "This is a hack of Super Mario Land version 1.1 for gameboy. I started making this after playing Frank15&#39;s enemy rearrangement hack. I thought it was great but I thought it needed more. So I started touching up the graphics and stuff. Then I wound up getting the idea of colorizing it. I held that off till I finished making the graphics. I made sure to leave no graphic untouched. Anyhow I had downloaded a 2.4 colorizer long ago and used it to colorize this. There was some problems that all people who have colorized this expereinced. Luckily Parasyte offered to lend me a  hand and fixed a problem I was having with the status bar. After the colorization I altered a few more sprites then released it. About a year later a friend (Ugetab) offered to help me further on my hack and fixed the remaining issues I have. And so now you have this version.

(i.e., Western equivalents of Japanese historic or mythological figures) The only exceptions, of course, are the Four Symbols: Gen-Bu, Sei-Ryu, Byak-Ko and Su-Zaku, as they are so strictly canonical and should not be changed.\n\nI made minimal edits to the game dialog, only making edits where necessary to reflect an updated item name. Frankly, trying to assemble a DTE table for the game was a nightmare.\n\nA few other notes:\n\n - GP was changed to Kr, to reflect &#34;Kero&#34; (the game&#39;s original currency)\n\n - There are some quirky strings in the game; such as &#34;He don&#39;t&#34; when trying to replace a still-living character at the guild - I did not edit these, as I don&#39;t have a completed DTE table to work with\n\n - I used some of the bug-fixes from another hacker&#39;s patch, since I had forgotten they were already applied to my copy of the ROM before I made the text edits (hopefully, he doesn&#39;t mind; but I have no way to contact him for proper permissions)", "reldate": "14 April 2010", "rominfo": "File:               Final Fantasy Legend, The (USA).gb\nCRC32:              8046148F\nMD5:                D5C27FF8 CB1B69CB 56DF4FF1 70E2BAF0\nSHA1:               901DFC83 C72E172D 35A37683 5807FC78 8444A9BB", "author": "fflegend", "filekey": "638"}, "503": {"title": "Pokemon Thunder Yellow", "description": "This is a complete improvement over the original game.

The games that were never released outside Japan, with other countries instead getting Red and Blue versions.\nHowever, the original Green version seems to be getting more attention than the original Red version, since the rest of the world got a Red version, but not a Green version.\n\nMany have tried translating the original Japanese version of Green into English.\nSome have done a pretty decent work, but they all were crippled by the limits of the original Green rom.\n\nAfter buying a Japanese version of Green on eBay, I played through it for a while. Eventually reached the fourth badge, then decided to start over for various reasons.\n\nI felt like this game should get a proper translation. The previous translations of Green all suffered of cut-down names for Pokémon and attacks because the original Red and Green versions had a limited amount of characters available for names.\nThat wasn&#39;t a problem, since five letters were more than enough for the original Japanese names.\n\nThis started out as me wanting to edit Pokémon Blue to turn it into an English Green version. I asked for help at Skeetendo, and people helped me.\nAfter a while, more and more people became interested in the project and the one-man team evolved into a three-, four-, five-man team.\nUnfortunately, I ended up doing the least work in total, but I plan to catch up on this by doing the same thing with Red, using the hacking experience earned from this to complete it alone.\n\nThis is a hack of Pokémon Blue version that is meant to re-create the original experience of Pokémon Green.\nAlmost everything has been changed back to what they were like in the original Green version.\nFor those interested in playing Green, but were put off by the language barrier or bad translation, this is for you.\n\n———\n\nAn user by the name of Montblanc has recently started working on this to improve it and change/fix pretty much everything that was wrong with the old version.\n\nThey have done an absolutely amazing job at it and I believe that we can call this the best English Green version we may ever get.\n\nThe list of changes they&#39;ve made is massive, but you can see their original post here, where everything is listed: https://hax.iimarck.us/post/43630/\n\n\nQuoted from their original post:\n\n&#34;Green_full are both patches merged, ready to be used on a Pokémon Blue retail ROM.\nGreen_upgrade contains only the data I changed from the Green 2011 ROM, and has to be used only on said ROM.\n\nInside the optional folder there are three patches that can be used after using one of the two above. &#34;Enable Flashes&#34; restores the quick flashing animations of moves like Thunderbolt or Hyper Beam. &#34;Enable Blizzard&#34; restores the 30% chance of freezing the target for that move, but can glitch the linked battles when it is used against a Red or Blue game. The third one restores both.&#34;\n\nFor most people, you want Green_full.ips\n\n———\n\nMontblanc is to be credited for everything they&#39;ve added to improve this and make it at close as possible to the original Green version, but in English. This includes -a lot- of very minute details, and they&#39;ve also completely re-done some of the changes that had been made in the old version.

Initially the Gym Leaders will stick to their specialty types, but as soon as you get to the Rival in Ecruteak, they will start to use diverse pokemon with a few of these specialty types, using moves corresponding to that type as coverage or status, and sometimes, counters. These major bosses include Team Rocket Executives, the Elite Four, and Champions.\n\nAfter seven badges, you will face against very powerful enemies with fully evolved and dangerous pokemon, and you will eventually reach level 100 after the eight badge.

The selected rod did not affect whether the player could reel in the line or not, it was determined by the selection of using either a float or a sinker. Meaning that the player could reel in the line with a normal bait rod, that has no reel, when using a sinker. And when float fishing using a casting rod, equipped with a reel, the player was unable to reel in the line. This improvement patch alters the mechanic so that the player can never reel in the line with normal bait rods only with casting rods, regardless if using a float or a sinker. This is how it works in the rest of the series as well as the GBA remake (Kawa no Nushi Tsuri 3+4) that was released later on.[/li]\n\n[li][B]Parallax flicker fix:[/B] The raster flicker that appeared in the parallax scrolling background when fighting a fish underwater is now eliminated.[/li]\n\n[li][B]Fish metasprite fix:[/B] Eight of the fishes in the game had missing sprites in a few frames of their animation. It was easily noticeable with a fish like the Gi.Trout, the second frame of animation was missing 3 sprites that constituted the last pixel row of the tail, so it looked a bit &#39;cut off&#39;. With this fix there are no longer any missing sprites in any of the fish metasprites.[/li]\n[/list]\n[B]New in version 1.0[/B]\n[list]\n[li][B]Fun lake fix:[/B] Only 30 different fishes were available to be caught in fun lake due to a bug, also a handful of the 30 species were much more common than others. This fix enables all 39 fishes, that should be available, to be caught as well as improving the randomness of which species one will catch.[/li]\n\n[li][B]Fun lake record fix:[/B] The only way one could get the &#39;It&#39;s a record!&#39; message in fun lake was to catch any fish with the exact length of 67cm. This is now corrected and the game only displays the message when one have actually caught a fish of record length.[/li]\n\n[li][B]Raft bug fix:[/B] Under certain conditions the raft could &#39;lock&#39; and keep paddling continuously in one direction. Pressing the d-pad or any of the buttons wouldn&#39;t do anything, the raft would just keep going until it hit land or an obstacle, no matter how far away.

This is mainly noticeable in late Johto and Kanto.\n-Made all Gym Leaders rematchable. Just talk to them again and they will ask for a rematch.\n-Removed the badge boosts and the extra chances the AI has to miss on status moves to create parity between the player and the AI.\n-Ho-Oh and Lugia have their signature moves when you encounter them.\n-Reuseable TM&#39;s.\n-Hold down B to run.\n-Restored Japanese sprites for the Beauty, Sage, Medium, female Swimmer and Fisherman.\n-Simplified the clock reset procedure on the intro screen. Simply hold down &#34;Down&#34;, &#34;B&#34; and &#34;Select&#34;. No need to enter in a password.\n\nUpdate (29/01/2018):\n-Restored the original Japanese sprite for Jynx.\n\nUpdate (08/02/2018):\n-Tiny adjustment to a single trainer&#39;s Pokemon levels that was missed.\n\nUpdate (25/06/2018):\n-The readme file has been updated with the secret locations for the legendary birds and Mew at the bottom of the document.

Perhaps the most glaring of these is its peculiar soundtrack, which is bizarrely high-pitched, off-key, and extremely grating compared to pretty much any other Game Boy game, let alone the rest of the series.\n\nThis hack attempts to improve the music by fixing two apparent errors:\n\n1. The first is an objective programming mistake: the game&#39;s note-to-frequency conversion table is wrong. Some values are correct while others are one higher than they should be, resulting in over a quarter of the notes playing off-key.\n\n2. The more obvious problem, and the more subjective one, is that much of the music has the lead instruments set an octave higher than most people find pleasant.\n\nProblem 1 is a simple fix: the frequency table has been regenerated with the correct values, fixing the out-of-tune notes.\n\nProblem 2 has been handled, in most cases, by lowering the two square channels (used for leads) one octave and leaving the wavetable channel (used for bass) untouched. A few tracks have been handled specially; see the readme for details.\n\nNote that the sound effects are unchanged, as they&#39;re stored in a different format that directly specifies the intended frequencies instead of doing a note-to-frequency conversion.\n\nIncluded in the download are three IPS files, one for each of the game&#39;s regional variants (Japan, USA, and Europe).", "reldate": "29 September 2019", "rominfo": "===Japanese Version===\nNo-Intro filename: Rockman World 2 (Japan).gb\nCRC32:             C34D265E\nMD5:               C05B47DF8BDFE770BE228E51BC42DA84\nSHA-1:             5D35BAA2FADD07796ED8B441F82ED5B136A999C7\n===USA Version===\nNo-Intro filename: Mega Man II (USA).gb\nCRC32:             E496F686\nMD5:               7FE07271D04ED9E0BC0663DDE55A2AE4\nSHA-1:             334F1A93346D55E1BE2967F0AF952E37AA52FCA7\n===European Version===\nNo-Intro filename: Mega Man II (Europe).gb\nCRC32:             5E90CB48\nMD5:               B9CFEE05797BEB8FF7E259EE77EAF2FB\nSHA-1:             D19993A4630E7F9450FF6469115F4095F6F29667", "author": "Supper", "filekey": "4695"}, "4258": {"title": "Refill Weapon after Death", "description": "This patch is meant to make the game a bit easier and less frustrating.

The goal of this detailed and faithful  hack is to purely improve the original game with minor adjustments such as making all 251 Pokemon catch-able, adding a run button, tweaking the battle difficulty late-game to match that of the more balanced Heart Gold/Soul Silver late-game, and patching-out unwanted glitches in the original game.\n\nPokemon Perfect Crystal (2020 Update) is a small fix for Superegz&#39;s hack that corrects a couple of fan complaints, see original page&#39;s reviews. The 2020 Update is a complete patch, just apply it to the original game and play.\n\n2020 Update:\n\n1. Encounter rates for newly-added non-legendary encounters have been increased from 1% to at least 5%. The author went as far as to think about how long a player might spend in the areas these Pokemon appear in and adjusted the encounter rate accordingly.\n\n2. Red&#39;s Pokemon levels have been reverted from 100 back to the original levels from Pokemon Crystal. No more grinding for hours to beat the final boss.\n\n3. Totodile and Squirtle have been moved from Whirl Island to earlier locations in the game. This makes it so that all three Johto starters can be caught early in the game, and all three Kanto starters can be caught by mid-game. \n\n4. Tweaks were made to time of day encounters for some of the added encounters that seemed obvious(Omanyte and Kabuto appearing at different times of day for example).\n\nSpecifics of the 2020 Update:\n Girafarig encounter rate increased from 1% to 30% and made encounter-able any time of day (now matches Gold/Silver).\n Chikorita encounter rate increased from 1% to 10%\n Cyndaquil encounter rate increased from 1% to 40%\n Totodile moved from Whirl Island to Route 32 grass (early route near multiple bodies of water). Encounter rate increased from 1% to 20%. Time of encounter changed from morning to day. \n Bulbasaur encounter rate changed from 1% to 5%\n Charmander encounter rate changed from 1% to 10%\n Squirtle moved from Whirl Island to Union Cave B1F, land and surf. Encounter rate increased from 1% to 20% (40% if surfing). Time of encounter changed from night to morning/day.\n Omanyte time of encounter changed from night to morning/day.\n Kabuto encounter rate changed from 5% to 10%.\n Red&#39;s Pokemon levels changed from 100 to original levels (81, 73, 75, 77, 77, 77).", "reldate": "10 February 2020", "rominfo": "Database match: Pokemon - Crystal Version (USA, Europe) (Rev A)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20180815-131105)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: F2F52230B536214EF7C9924F483392993E226CFB\nFile/ROM CRC32: 3358E30A", "author": "aleckermit", "filekey": "4935"}, "4510": {"title": "Tetris Increase Multiplayer Lines", "description": "The original Tetris for Game Boy when played in multiplayer mode had a limit of 30 lines.\n\nWith this patch you have FF (255) lines instead of 30.\n\nThere is a patch for Tetris (World) v1.0 and v1.1.", "reldate": "24 February 2020", "rominfo": "Database match: Tetris (Japan) (En)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20180815-131105)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: 3F2A6407C9900AD5817EE1CFB3609C5EE17400FC\nFile/ROM CRC32: 63F9407D", "author": "Alex", "filekey": "4960"}, "4515": {"title": "Tetris Unlimited Multiplayer Lines", "description": "The original Tetris for the Game Boy when played in multiplayer mode had a limit of 30 lines.\n\nWith this patch you have an unlimited number of lines, the counter will stay at 30.\n\nThere is a patch for Tetris (World) v1.0 and v1.1.", "reldate": "25 February 2020", "rominfo": "Database match: Tetris (Japan) (En)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20180815-131105)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: 3F2A6407C9900AD5817EE1CFB3609C5EE17400FC\nFile/ROM CRC32: 63F9407D", "author": "Alex", "filekey": "4965"}, "4538": {"title": "Trip World Casual Mode", "description": "A hack to make this game easier!\nThe concept of &#39;lives&#39; have been removed, so there&#39;s no game over.\nThe health of the player has been raised from 4, to 6.\nRecovery items have been updated to account for this.\nGraphics/HUD have been changed to remove the lives, and show the 6 health.\n\nFor a write up about this hack - read here: https://jtm.gg/trip-world-gameboy-hack/", "reldate": "03 October 2019", "rominfo": "Database match: Trip World (Japan)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20180815-131105)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: AC19D49906E72AAEBEFFA9AB7106EB346A5EFA07\nFile/ROM CRC32: 11568E64", "author": "llakssz", "filekey": "4990"}, "4566": {"title": "Mega Man Xtreme - Xtreme Mode from start", "description": "This patch enables to play the Hard Mode and Xtreme mode from the start of the game without any previous complete saving. \n\nThis is useful for people who would like to play a specific part of the game, skip cutscenes or for speedrunners of the Xtreme mode.", "reldate": "25 March 2020", "rominfo": "Database match: Mega Man Xtreme (USA, Europe) (GB Compatible)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20180815-131105)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: C877449BA0889FDCACF23C49B0611D0CA57283C5\nFile/ROM CRC32: 3A4D94D5", "author": "ElwinBran", "filekey": "5020"}, "4567": {"title": "Mega Man Xtreme 2 - Xtreme Mode from start", "description": "This patch enables the Boss Rush and Xtreme Mode from the start of the game, without a complete save data required. \nThe patch does not change the games way of handling save data thus keeping saves compatible with the original game.\n\nThis patch is useful for speedrunners and people who do not want to complete the full game before playing the extra game modes.", "reldate": "25 March 2020", "rominfo": "Database match: Mega Man Xtreme 2 (USA, Europe)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20180815-131105)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: CB1811AC8969F6B683DF954B57138DD28EBB40FF\nFile/ROM CRC32: 8FEDB6D8", "author": "ElwinBran", "filekey": "5021"}, "4576": {"title": "Pokémon Crystal - Battle Tower Enhanced", "description": "this hack changes the battle tower to allow you and your opponent to bring 6 pokemon with no item clause. all the oppoenents you face have the stats they would have at level 100 along with max DVs and stat EXP.\n\nTHIS HACK WAS DESIGNED TO BE USED WITH A SAVE EDITOR.\nPKHeX is the best one, since its compatible with every generation, and can directly edit stat values:\nhttps://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/1-PKHeX/\n(if you dont have your own save file to transfer mons from, there is one included for you to play around with. but like pokemon stadium, this game is better w mons from your own adventures)\n\nthere are  two versions of this hack. generally the difference is this:\n-[Vanilla] only changes the battle tower mechanics.

These go for both versions.\n-Removed item clause (can bring as many leftovers as you want)\n-Can bring 6 pokémon\n-opponent brings 6 pokémon\n-streak lasts for 4 trainers\n\n        Battle Tower Trainers. The vanilla version has the same mons as regular pokémon crystal.\n-all the pokémon you face have the stats they would have at level 100.\n-nearly all BTmons that had gold berries now have leftovers\n-seismic toss and night shade always do 100 HP\n-enemy levels changed to represent what level of the tower youre on (doesnt affect their stats, they still are functionally at level 100)\n-enemy ai changed to switch more often\n-(Krusty ver still updating all BTmons, up to level 3 and ubers done)\n\n        Pokémon Stat Updates\n-Only stat changes in the vanilla ver are prevos. they mostly have their stats changed to match their evolutions, but never creating a new mon (horsea has seadra&#39;s gen 1 stats but seadra itself is now part dragon and has kingdras stats)\nIn krusty ver, more mon stats have been edited.\n-megas are represented by giving the Pokémon half its stat boosts.\n-alolan versions and some newer mons are referenced through type changes (pidgey gains fire typing like talonflame)\n\n        Battle Mechanic Updates (Krusty ver only).\n-Physical/Special Split\n-Fairy type\n-Crit chances edited (no random crits, only thru scope lens, focus energy, etc)\n-Move list edited to include necessary moves (Drill Run, Air Slash, Dark Pulse)\n-Redundant moves replaced w good ones (Ember to Will-o-Wisp, Bubble to Scald)\n-More boosting moves and a whole lot more secondary effects\nand more technical shit like\n-gen 1 Hyper Beam\n-Solarbeam deals 70 damage normally and double in sun\n-Whirlpool that can enact rain\n-Horn Leech that enacts leech seed\n-Volt Switch and U-Turn (deal less damage but keep stat stages)\n\nThe Krusty version is more actively developed so the patch uploaded here is almost guaranteed to be out of date. although feedback on it would still be great! Especially if you manage to play this with friends, I&#39;d like to hear what about kinda sets yall come up with and the meta that evolves. Keep in mind that move compatibility isnt enforced in any way and theres still some things i gotta work out, but honestly if you look at a mon&#39;s future movepool and see it gets something similar or does the same thing, just go for it and see if youre havin fun or not\n\n\nlink to the hack&#39;s github:\nhttps://github.com/KrustyKong/pokecrystal-battletower-enhanced\n\nbased on the crystal disassembly:\nhttps://github.com/pret/pokecrystal\n\nif you have the urge to play actual pokemon crystal, check out Pokemon Crystal Clear by shockslayer\nhttps://shockslayer.com\n\ncrystal clear save files dont work with this hack, so feel free to edit the included save file.

The early game of Red is very much a slog, and so the patcher has tried to liven it up in a few ways.\n\n1. Different starters. The starters have been changed to Ditto, Rhyhorn, and Porygon. Ditto allows for quick access to Cooltrainer Corruption, opening up lots of fun stuff early on. Rhyhorn evolves into Rhydon, the pokemon you get if you capture the first Missigno you meet, so that seemed appropriate. And finally, Porygon just happens to be the patcher&#39;s favorite 1st-Gen pokemon, so in it goes.\n\n2. The text about the starters (&#34;So! You want...&#34;) was changed in PokeText. Also, all rival battles are changed to use the new starters. This is just for consistency&#39;s sake, and not for any convenience reasons.\n\n3. The pokemon found in Route 1 now greatly vary, in order to make early game teams interesting, and full of options. For a breakdown of the pokemon and their percents, see below:\n\nVulpix L4 25%\n\nMankey L4 15%\n\nSpearow L4 15%\n\nMangemite L4 10%\n\nAbra L4 10%\n\nJigglypuff L4 10%\n\nSeel L4 5%\n\nDiglett L4 5%\n\nDratini L4 4%\n\nREDACTED L5 1% (it&#39;s a surprise!)\n\n4. Some of the above pokemon are given some extra moves from the start, in order to spice up early battles. Those moves are described below: Vulpix gains Ember (since it&#39;s a Fire-type move), Seel gains Bubble (since it&#39;s a Water-type move), Jigglypuff gains Pound (since it&#39;s a damaging move), Magnemite gains Thunderwave (since it&#39;s literally any move other than tackle, and allows for a paralysis niche), and Spearow gains Harden (to make &#34;Brock Through Walls&#34; possible to perform).\n\n5. Fly is sold at the Vermilion mart, and Surf is sold at the Fuschia mart. This is both so fly is unlocked earlier (thereby making Old Man Glitch, trainer-fly, etc. able to happen  quicker), and so no-one has to find that accursed Safari Zone house ever again.\n\nVERSION 1.1 CHANGES\nHaving realized that going to the Safari House is needed to gain Strength as well as Surf, the patcher added the ability to buy Strength from the city you unlock the ability to use it at (like what was done with Fly and Surf). That is, Strength can now be bought at Celadon, specifically at the vendor on the right in the Department Store&#39;s second floor. Alas, one of the TMs sold by that vendor had to be replaced; TM07 Horn Drill was chosen, since it is an OHKO move.\n\nCredits\n-Thanks to everyone who made those lovely programs over at Swampert&#39;s Tools, without which this patch could never have been made.\n-Thanks to the creators of LIPS, who were able to strip the above tools&#39; changes out into a patch.", "reldate": "26 June 2021", "rominfo": "Database match: Pokemon - Red Version (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20180815-131105)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: EA9BCAE617FDF159B045185467AE58B2E4A48B9A\nFile/ROM CRC32: 9F7FDD53", "author": "OEA", "filekey": "5692"}, "5214": {"title": "Tetris Plus blocks", "description": "A reskin for the classic Gameboy Tetris changing the blocks to the ones from Tetris Plus.\n\nIncludes three versions\n\n- The Japanese release\n- The English release\n- The [url=https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/5125/]Tetris - Classic Harddrop hack[/url] made by Ospin\n\n- 1st image is original\n- 2nd image is original in GBC mode\n- 3rd image is Tetris Plus\n- 4th image is Tetris Plus in GBC mode", "reldate": "01 February 2021", "rominfo": "Database match: Tetris (Japan) (En)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20180815-131105)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: 3F2A6407C9900AD5817EE1CFB3609C5EE17400FC\nFile/ROM CRC32: 63F9407D\n-\nDatabase match: Tetris (World) (Rev A)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20180815-131105)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: 74591CC9501AF93873F9A5D3EB12DA12C0723BBC\nFile/ROM CRC32: 46DF91AD", "author": "AyanamiRei0", "filekey": "5702"}, "5218": {"title": "Pokémon Crystal Maeson", "description": "Pokémon Crystal Maeson, like other hacks of the same author, aims to give a game he has played a lot a different flair through a variety of changes, so it keeps feeling fresh or more interesting to his own particular tastes.\n\nOn 20/03/23 it was updated once more, to fix a couple of mistakes, simplify the Clock Reset procedure, and a couple of minor changes.\n\nOn 04/09/22 it was updated once again, to fix one palette error on Crobat&#39;s back sprite. People asked to add the Shiny icon to the Naming Screen, and it was also added. \n\nOn 21/08/22 this hack has been updated to include optional patches to remove flashes during battles and while walking with poisoned Pokémon. This is something several people brought up to the author of this hack, and he was happy to give the choice as, pure white to pure black flashing effects can be painful to most people&#39;s eyes, specially if playing with back-lighted screens.\n\nTo avoid confusion, the patches inside the 7zip file have been organized on folders to make things simpler. \n\nHack Updated to version 1.3. Significant rework on Pokémon Stats both in BST and stat spreads, fixed a number of mistakes in several areas, Freeze has been changed for Frostbite, etc. Battle Tower was updated to count for the changes too.\n\nVersion 1.2 was a smaller update, containing fixes for a few mistakes, and a considerable number of changes on Moves looking to make more moves interesting options to use.\n\nVersion 1.1 brings a slew of improvements and also bring back elements that where cut for the first public release regarding how Types interact with each other. These cause a large number of changes to Stats, Types, Moves, and more, you can check the updated readme to see them. Corrections were also made on the several text files, which had a number of errors.\n\nHere&#39;s a general summary of some of the changes made by this hack:\n\n·Moving away from the &#34;vanilla Pokémon experience&#34; by making a different &#34;balance&#34; for the Pokémon themselves. This means new Type Matchups to make Types equal, giving many species different Types, new Stat distributions for each evolutionary line and putting them at the same level, streamlining evolution across all species and more.\n\n·To help with the above, the Pokédex has been changed. It no longer offers the dubious trivia it originally had, and now provides both a list of Weaknesses and Resistances and the Base Stats of each species to help the player.\n\n·A Physical/Special split has been added, and beyond that, many old moves have been taken out to implement new ones in order to give each Type moves of different Power tiers for both Physical and Special sides. There has been no intent to follow trends made by newer games with the new moves, though. \n\n·An effort has also been made to streamline all stuff related with training and RNG. DVs/IVs no longer factor in Stat Calculations, meaning any Pokémon can reach full potential (Shiny and Female Pokémon included, of course). Acquiring Stat Experience is a far less frustrating process now, as there has been changes to Vitamins in addition to new Items to make them actually useful this time, and you will need to pay attention and take care of your team this way.\n\n·There has been a fair increase in the overall difficulty of the game. The AI has been improved, Levels have been raised (Generation 2 had a rather low Level curve), teams for pretty much every trainer out there have been tweaked (which, with the prior changes and having to learn new stuff does in fact increase the challenge), and the Pokémon from Trainers do get progressively harder as you progress because just like you, they also get Stat Experience, and after a point all of them will have fully trained Pokémon. Badge bonuses and NPC &#34;nerfs&#34; have been removed too, among other changes.\n\n·Another big point of this hack is a huge rework of the Battle Tower. Besides renewing the Pokémon you fight there to be in line with the new changes made to the hack (and also adding a lot more variety to the species you find there), a lot of new stuff has been added to it. Among other things, Move Tutors of various types and a reward system where you can get Special Eggs with Pokémon that know a unique move, somewhat similar to what Pokémon Stadium did. This place is much more than it ever was.\n\n·Some &#34;endgame&#34; content was added too, in the form of rematches and other things. Once you beat Red, the Elite Four gets stronger and Gym Leaders want to fight again (not the only ones though). To help levelling up, a series of helpful Items were added to the Battle Tower. Pokégear Rematches also had some pretty substantial upgrades compared to the original.\n\n·There has been a number of changes to Items and Item storage too. There are a few new Items, such as Fruits that help you strengthen your Pokémon, and Kurt Balls are now very different from what thy were in the original game.\n\n·While there&#39;s no intention to create a new story or region, there are some new maps here and there, sometimes to bring back stuff like the Viridian Forest, others to expand certain places that felt short, or simply a few new areas. There were also many small additions and changes made throughout the game, way too many to point out here.\n\n·Big changes to the graphics in many areas. Pokémon sprites were cleaned up, improved or changed (they also have individual icons for each and Shiny colors were altered too), the overworld graphics had also some touches here and there. Many areas had some edits here and there to make them feel better to traverse or to look at, and the scrolling is also smoother. In general, the colors used by the game are less saturated so its easier to the eyes when playing on anything with a back-lighted screen. Also some menus and other UI stuff got redesigns to make them easier to the eye, and hopefully more clear to see.\n\nThere&#39;s much, much more to the changes, but if you want to read more about it you have the usual &#34;why this is so long&#34; readme included. In fact, there&#39;s a variety of files with different information to help accommodate people to all these modifications, in case you have ages of free time to read it all!", "reldate": "20 March 2023", "rominfo": "Database match: Pokemon - Crystal Version (USA, Europe) (Rev A)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20180815-131105)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: F2F52230B536214EF7C9924F483392993E226CFB\nFile/ROM CRC32: 3358E30A", "author": "Maeson", "filekey": "5706"}, "5237": {"title": "Mega Man: Return of Wily", "description": "This is a hack of the USA version of the game &#34;Mega Man - Dr. Wily&#39;s Revenge&#34;.\n\n\nThis is the story: Wily has returned to try to achieve the World Domination again!

All updates were seriously considered to make the most sense without affecting lore, story, or mechanics.\n\n2) To replace any direct, real-world, location references with updated and relevant Pokémon-world references (Example: Lt.Surge the Lightning American is now The Lightning Unovan, as newer games reveal that he is a native born Unovan.)\n\n3) To NOT go overboard with edits! The project does not add new sprites, new music, new regions, new characters, new moves, higher difficulties, etc... It doesn&#39;t even &#34;fix&#34; attacks. It does, however, slightly edit Fuchsia City so movement is easier (does not introduce any game skips, whatsoever - just a Quality of Life change.)\n\nThis is supposed to be as vanilla as it gets, but also to feel as official as it can be. All re-introduced Pokémon are not simply dumped into easy locations, but they are also not impossibly rare - NONE are at 1% spawn rate. - Everything was thought-out for balance and to fit into the already established story (in some cases, improving the story). The entire game should be doable without a guide. Newcomers should be able to playthrough and succeed simply by talking to NPCs and doing battles and exploring. Older fans will be able to do most of this game from memory - It is not supposed to feel like a rom hack.\n\nUpdate 1.2: Changed one trade so that NPC dialogue post trade makes sense.\n\nUpdate 1.2.1: Added an optional &#34;MissingNo Patch&#34; so players can re-enable MissingNo encounters.\n\n- Razormime", "reldate": "02 March 2021", "rominfo": "Database match: Pokemon - Blue Version (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20180815-131105)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: D7037C83E1AE5B39BDE3C30787637BA1D4C48CE2\nFile/ROM CRC32: D6DA8A1A", "author": "Razormime", "filekey": "5742"}, "5257": {"title": "Pokemon Yellow - 151", "description": "Pokémon Yellow - 151 is intended for emulator players who simply want to play through the original Pokémon Yellow, complete their Pokédex 100%, and have access to the surfing beach-house. The problems with playing on emulators these days is that there are no promotional Pokémon events to go to, there is no connectivity to Pokémon Stadium, and trading across games, while possible, is not only tricky to do, but also feels totally un-natural. Many players have solved the problem by using cheat-codes to temporarily activate the ability to capture the &#34;missing Pokémon&#34;, but to many players it still feels unnatural and, well, like cheating.\n\t\n The solutions implemented here are supposed to feel as natural as possible, where players should not feel as if they&#39;ve cheated or that they are even playing a hack - think of this project as more of a patch. Players will have the ability to encounter all missing Pokémon in the most organic ways possible, where each encounter, trade, and shop edit has been carefully planned, with strong consideration of: where and how Pokémon have appeared in all Red, Blue, and Green games; where and how specific Pokémon have appeared in the anime series; game story; game balancing and playability\n\t\t\n The only other liberty taken with this patch is to replace any real-world references (locations and animals) with appropriate Pokémon world counterparts. In doing so, the patch once again carefully considers main-line Pokémon game stories and has retconned the relevant new information into those replacements: The chef on the S.S. Anne has replaced the salmon on his menu, and Lt. Surge is no longer known as the Lightning American - but rest assured, Pokémon fans will be more than happy with the replacements. - any text which did not need changes has been left alone! The only other line that has changed, is that the game programmer&#39;s computer which tells you not to mess with the code, now reveals the patch version number (Currently V3.0). Nothing else has been changed! There are no new sprites, routes, items, methods, or difficulties...\n\nPlease enjoy the ultimate vanilla Pokémon Yellow experience! Players will be able to complete the game 100% without the need for the guide. However, for those who are okay with spoilers, the included guide offers detailed information on all Pokémon locations and other edits made to the game.\n\nNote: This update must be applied to a clean Pokémon Yellow rom. Players can continue playing with old save files as long as they take care that the new, patched 3.0 rom and their old save file have the exact same name (do not change the extension). \n\nV3.0 UPDATE: \nPikachu now learns SURF through HM03, and no longer knows SURF from the beginning of the game!", "reldate": "27 July 2021", "rominfo": "Database match: Pokemon - Yellow Version - Special Pikachu Edition (USA, Europe) (GBC,SGB Enhanced)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20180815-131105)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: CC7D03262EBFAF2F06772C1A480C7D9D5F4A38E1\nFile/ROM CRC32: 7D527D62", "author": "Razormime", "filekey": "5746"}, "5316": {"title": "Amogus: Sus Version", "description": "What if Pokémon were sus?

The original Dragon Warrior Monsters localization is one of the poorest done official translations in the DQ series, being rife with translation errors, having extensive spelling, grammar, and punctuation issues, phrases that didn&#39;t make any sense, a vast amount of missing humor and main-series references, as well as the typical kinds of censorship that were standard for that era. This project includes a thorough retranslation straight from the Japanese, where every line of text has been meticulously reviewed. In addition to addressing all of the problems outlined above, a great deal more personality was given to everyone from the basic NPCs to the dramatic series of archfiend encounters in post game. With those improvements, along with better formatting and improved overall flow and readability, the authors are confident that this new script will significantly enhance the experience of playing Dragon Quest Monsters.\n\n\tSeveral other highly conservative miscellaneous fixes and improvements have been included. These include a new Dragon Quest title screen pulled directly from the German release of the game, bugfixes for incorrect experience points given by monsters in the Metal Slime group, and correction of errors to monster pixel art.\n\n\tIn keeping with the Delocalized moniker, this project utilizes conventions for monsters, spells, and item names that translate the Japanese namings faithfully, in keeping with the namings used in Translation Quest&#39;s DQ1-3 projects. With those extensive changes, the authors became concerned about the difficulty of players utilizing existing guides for the purpose of planning out their breeding and skill/magic acquisition. Therefore, a completely new guide using the Delocalized naming conventions has been included in the zip file for download.

Since it is pretty buggy, use Wrap Improvements at your own peril; I have no plans to fix it, but will leave it up for posterity. My new, amazing hack can be found at https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6124/ \n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\n\nIt has come to the patcher&#39;s attention that there are multiple actual bugs in the hack, of arguable severity. Alas, due to the march of progress on a much larger hack which is to contain this one and more, this hack can&#39;t be easily fixed (although the larger hack will fix these issues).\n-One: In order for trapping moves to deal damage not based on the opponent&#39;s past move now that the last move is not the trapping move, it had to be that damage was recalculated each hit. However, this would also mean an accuracy check, which the patcher tried to bypass in order that continuing hits could not miss. However, due to the unusual game logic, this bypassing also made the actual moves unable to ever miss. So, uh, good luck.\n-Two: the level swapping detailed below is the result of the aforementioned bypassing also bypassing the swap back of enemy and player levels, from being swapped for calculations. Thus, it is recommended to be safe that players defeat a Pokémon or switch when the levels are in the unswapped position, which should happen every other turn under a trapping move  used by the Enemy, specifically.\nWatch for the aforementioned larger hack, in which the patcher gives up and just lets continuing hits miss.\nNow, back to the original description:\n\n\n\n\nThe mechanics of Wrap and other trapping moves in Generation 1 are extremely frustrating. One is expected to sit there, entirely unable to attack, as the opponent spams a low-power, but high-accuracy move. This hack aims to modify those mechanics in order to make them similar to later games. That is, trapping moves allow one to attack, but not to swap out. And really, that&#39;s the whole hack, with a few caveats listed below.\n\nFirstly, if one tries to swap out, one will be denied with the message &#34;X is already out!&#34; Although recycling a message like that is not ideal, the creation of a new message is a bit beyond the patcher&#39;s capabilities, and given the notorious space limitations of the game, could cause unintended problems.\n\nSecondly, some graphical issues occur with trapping moves. For one thing, sometimes the level of the player and enemy will swap. This seems to be a mechanic used internally, which for whatever reason is being shown as a result of the patch. This is not a permanent change, and will not affect the true levels of your Pokémon outside of battle.\n\nAnother issue that has been very rarely encountered is that if an opposing Pokémon faints during a trapping move, the player&#39;s Pokémon may be sent out again, then the message that the enemy fainted is shown again, and then the XP is awarded. Interestingly, and fortuitously, this has only been encountered in wild battles, and no actual problems have occurred.\n\nFinally, along with patches to change this mechanic for both Red and Blue, this hack archive also contains versions of the patch which address a few smaller issues, which make for a smoother experience with sacrificing the...character, so to speak, of the game. Namely, Ghost type is now super-effective against Psychic type (which is surprisingly unhelpful, since that only applies to Lick), Focus Energy actually increases critical rate, an enemy&#39;s Psywave cannot deal 0 damage, and all parts of the player&#39;s accumulated Bide damage are cleared with the enemy switches out. The latter two are important fixes, since they are causes of Link Battle desynchronization. Also of note is what was not fixed, namely the wrap glitch involving Hyper Beam, and the issues surrounding Counter and switching out. Both require enough effort and preparation that they cannot ruin a game unsuspectingly, and fixing Counter involves a fundamental rewriting that goes beyond the scope of a sidebar to a hack.\n\nAs with any sort of hack, please speak up regarding any issues. In particular, given the irony involved, reports of issues this patch causes with regards to Link Battles are especially appreciated.\n\nCREDITS\n\nThanks to the maintainers of the Pokémon Red/Blue disassembly project at https://github.com/pret/pokered, without which none of this hack would be possible.", "reldate": "12 July 2021", "rominfo": "Database match: Pokemon - Red Version (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20210227-015730)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: EA9BCAE617FDF159B045185467AE58B2E4A48B9A\nFile/ROM CRC32: 9F7FDD53", "author": "OEA", "filekey": "6057"}, "5580": {"title": "Donkey Kong Land: New Colors Mode", "description": "This is a GameBoy to GameBoy Color conversion for Donkey Kong Land.

The patcher has moved on from this hack and is not interested in determining why this one fight is causing issues, so for now it is recommended that one makes use of either extremely powerful Pokémon that can near-instantly win the fight, or temporarily activates the GameShark code 0100E7CF, which causes all enemy Pokémon to start with 0 HP and instantly become knocked-out.\n\nASM Machina (a la &#34;Deus Ex Machina&#34;) is a wide-scale hack designed to change a variety of aspects of Pokémon Red&#39;s gameplay, to suit the tastes of the author. A full list (read: rambling notes) of changes can be found in the Readme (called Features and Fixes.txt in the archive). However, here are some of the major ones:\n- Everything from the previous hack Wrap Improvements has been incorporated, and all bugs that hack had should be fixed. The full rundown is in Features and Fixes.txt, but as the name implied the hack made Trapping moves not prevent the use of attacks, but rather the use of switching out, as in later generations\n- The starters have been replaced by Glitch Pokémon, specifically those which are read as trainers when doing a Special Stat Encounter (since they are hard to get as a result). Their description from Oak is that glitch trainer class. Please NOTE that, although in vanilla these Pokémon learn no problematic Unterminated Name glitch moves, no guarantees can be made with all the data this hack shifted around. If any issues are discovered, please write a review about it\n- All wild Pokémon data have been looked over and altered to promote variety. Further, Red and Blue now have the same data, to avoid the need for trades\n- Because Routes 12 on down have more trainers than Cycling Road, they consequently now have higher-level Pokémon. To prevent the player from bypassing this by just going a little east from Fuchsia, Route 15 has been altered to add ledges, so that one can leave it, but not return\n- All learned moves have been adjusted, for a more interesting experience, and to provide strategic incentive to withhold evolving\n- A radical shift in combat has occurred, wherein all moves have their PP divided by 5, but a key item is given out which can heal the party between battles. In this way, PP actually circumscribe gameplay, and more thought in move selection is warranted.\n- Furthermore, healing items beyond potion can no longer be bought in stores, forcing a game plan beyond &#34;heal spam.&#34; To aid in this, healing moves now have a chance to miss\n-Enemies now have finite PP, so that the player is not put at an unfair disadvantage. When a enemy&#39;s Pokémon runs out of moves, it will of course use Struggle, but at that point they often switch out now. Sometimes, enemies will use Elixirs, so you cannot completely stall them out of the game.\n- The Normal type is no more, replaced by the Sound type. Thus all normal moves have had their types diversified, making for a more interesting experience. Normal-type Pokémon have had their types changed as well\n-To counteract this increase in effective moves, the effectiveness multiplier has been reduced, scaling by 1.5/0.7 instead of 2.0/0.5.\n- The old man in Viridian City has had his dialogue restored to the Japanese original, since the whole &#34;coffee&#34; thing is both infamous and nonsensical. Here the patcher is indebted to the person behind the blog [url=https://kantopia.wordpress.com/]Kantopia[/url], who graciously gave permission to use the translation posted on that site (see the Readme for the link)\n- Rocket grunts have had their Pokémon greatly diversified, since they have no particular theme, and they appear a great many times. Furthermore, Gym trainers have all had their rosters looked over, in order to makes things not solely one type, but rather just focused on that type. Most all other trainers have had their parties edited and somewhat diversified as well\n- In addition to being usable against any type, most of if not all of the bugs associated with the move Counter should be fixed\n- Distributed to the player upon receiving the Potion sample on Route 1 is both the above key item, and an Exp All. The Exp All is now a key item, can distribute its secondary experience to fainted Pokémon, and distributes the full XP to combatants, and then the full XP to the whole party (instead of half and half). The goal here is to make grinding less of chore; if this is undesirable, one can simply store the item in the PC\n- Further, because of this granting, Oak&#39;s Aide no longer rewards the player with an Exp All. Instead, the player receives the glitch item Cascadebadge, which can &#34;throw rocks&#34; and thereby increase catch rate\n- The bag now holds 25 items, instead of 20, to make up for the above two items taking up slots. Please note that if one wishes to do Expanded Item Pack shenanigans, this should mean that all item slots one is told to use need to have 5 added to them\n- The &#34;Low Health&#34; alarm sound is entirely removed, because it is extremely irritating and does not accomplish much.\n-You can now see how much health the enemy has numerically, albeit in a hacky way and only when they take damage or heal (so grab a notebook!).\n\nCREDITS\n\nAs mentioned, thanks to the purposefully anonymous creator of the blog Kantopia, for the old man translation.\n\nThanks to Jojobear13, from whose hack shinpokered ([url]https://github.com/jojobear13/shinpokered[/url]) I got some of my finite PP code.\n\nAnd, of course, the greatest gratitude is extended to the people who have disassembled Pokémon Red/Blue over at https://github.com/pret/pokered.

It is now final for real!\n\nHere is the list of the majority of the changes:\n\n- Almost all Pokémon learns at least 1, 2 or 3 new moves at level 1! They are picked from their Egg moves list, or move tutor, up to Generation 7, even including Let’s Go Pikachu/Eevee.\n\n- Also, most Pokémon can learn new moves (from Gen 1, of course!) while they level-up as well. These moves have been taken from future generations (Even up to Gen 8!), egg moves or duplicates of the same great and essential moves that needed to be relearned (To avoid a Pokémon from being walled completely!). Each moveset have been carefully done, and in total, 553 new moves have been added among the 151 Pokémon (Except Ditto, Caterpie, Weedle and Magikarp, of course!)! Enjoy!\n\n- Geography has been enhanced! Routes are expanded a little, with some empty houses to make them habitable! (Just for decoration, you know)\n\n- Many important items have reduced prices (Mostly inspired by Pokémon Crystal’s clearance sales of Goldenrod City’s Dept-Store rooftop). The items include Poké Balls, potions, full Heal, revives, vitamins, etc. This will help you, especially in the beginning!\n\n- Some items, such as the Moon Stone, Ether and Elixer, now have a price, to match the legal price in later games.\n\n- All trainers, Gyms leaders, Rival battles and Elite 4 have changed significantly! They are all harder than before! Many have brand new Pokémon too! Some trainers even have up to 6 Pokémon on their team, so be prepared for some challenges! Also, movesets for Gyms and Elite Four have been carefully done and revised to give you a great challenge!\n\n- Your rival’s starter is a Dratini.\n\n- You can now buy all TMs at various Marts through Kanto. For example, you can buy TM19 and TM48 at Pewter City’s Mart.\n\n- TM04 is now Gust instead of Whirlwind (They are similar moves, right? Also, Whirlwind is completely useless in a trainer battle, so Gust is a slightly better option).\n\n- Some attacks have been readjusted to be like the future games (Like they should always have been in some cases!). \n\nFor example:\n[list]\n[list][li]Karate Chop is a Fighting-type move.[/li]\n[li]Gust is a Flying-type move.[/li]\n[li]Sand-Attack is a Ground-type move.[/li]\n[li]Mega Drain has a power of 75 and Absorb has a Power of 40 (That’s the same as LGP/LGE)[/li]\n[li]Jump Kick and Hi Jump Kick have power of 100 and 130 respectively (Like since Black/White!)[/li]\n[li]Dig and Fly has power of 80 and 90 respectively (Like since Diamond/Pearl!)[/li]\n[li]Other moves have been adjusted according to 7th Gen (Sun/Moon positives changes in power only).[/li]\n[li]You can get Mew via an In-game trade! (Cool!)[/li]\n[li]The Snorlax on Route 16 is level 35 (The other at Route 12 is level 40), Zapdos is level 45, Moltres is still level 50, Articuno is level 74 and Mewtwo is level 80.[/li]\n[/list]\n\n- Game corner prizes have changed: Meowth, Ekans and Koffing (Counter 1), Omanyte, Kabuto and Porygon (Counter 2), and PP UP, Moon Stone and Master Ball (Counter 3).\n\n- Wild Pokémon have changed significantly in every route, areas or caves, and even in the sea (See a joined Word Document for details). Also, each Pokémon is sure to appear in the wild in this game, but some are really very rare!\n\n- Many dialogs have changed or have been improved! You’ll mostly hear new dialogs about many things about friendship or life. \n\n- You can buy Rare Candies at Celadon Dept-Store (5F), which are sure to help you in the later part of the game. (Note you can still trade Pokémon by using TGB DUAL, and since traded Pokémon grow faster, it will sure help!)", "reldate": "24 May 2022", "rominfo": "Database match: Pokemon - Yellow Version - Special Pikachu Edition (USA, Europe) (CGB+SGB Enhanced)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20210227-015730)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: CC7D03262EBFAF2F06772C1A480C7D9D5F4A38E1\nFile/ROM CRC32: 7D527D62", "author": "ericgall23", "filekey": "6859"}, "6346": {"title": "Donkey Kong Land 2: Game Boy Color Edition", "description": "This patch will convert Donkey Kong Land 2 from a monochrome Game Boy game to a Game Boy Color game.

While this certainly made the soundtrack a small bit more bearable, it sounded still like a &#34;wall of notes&#34; that didn&#39;t sound all too great.\n\nWhat was done here was to first reverse-engineer the driver, understand how it worked, and modified the sound data directly. This allows one to effectively control what the driver does on a per-tick/note basis, and even allows for things like custom music and sound effects. As such, one can modify the existing songs to better sound like actual songs. The changes varied per-song, however. Tracks like Clash Man were already quite &#34;clean&#34; sounding, requiring little modification, while other songs like the Stage Select and Metal Man&#39;s theme required more extensive modification to the sound data.\n\nDespite these updates, The Author still does not consider this to be the &#34;perfect&#34; way to listen to the OST; An &#34;ideal&#34; Improvement Hack would ditch the original sound data entirely and create new arrangements from scratch, possibly even replacing the original sound driver.\n\nRegardless, The Author hopes you enjoy the improvement hack! Feedback would be highly appreciated with the songs, as there are some they are still trying to &#34;properly&#34; figure out how to make sound the best they possibly can.\n\n\nNote: Although the hack was made specifically for the Japanese Rockman World 2, it has been tested and compatible with all releases, such as the USA and EU releases.

The piece shapes are made out of 5 blocks instead of the normal 4 blocks in regular Tetris.  It ends up being quite fun.\n\nCompleting an actual [i]Tetris[/i] (clearing 4 lines at once) is still the maximum number of lines cleared.  This is because the game engine is not expecting 5 lines cleared at once.  (Being able to play using 5 block shapes is still pretty cool since the NES version of Tetris can not even do that without major reworking.)\n\nOne neat side effect is that the two L pieces can now complete a Tetris in certain situations.\n\nNote:  The “Next Piece” preview window itself does not want to display pieces made out of more than 4 blocks, seemingly because of a max sprites on screen issue.  Fixing that would probably require some assembly work which is beyond the scope of this mod.  To account for this, the pieces are orientated in a way that should still allow the player to infer which one is next.\n\n\nAll game modes, even 2 player, have been tested.\n\nThis mod is for the more common 1.1 version of Gameboy Tetris.\n\n[i]EDIT:  Version 1.1[/i]\n\n[i]The Rosy version of Quintris was not showing the correct future previews for 2 and 3 pieces ahead.

That routine was failing during pause because it is not expecting the Quintris piece shapes.  So pause was simply disabled, which makes everything still work perfectly.  You should still be able to pause using whatever device you are playing this on, except for original hardware.\n\nAlso, like the Note above, the Next Piece preview window only displays 4 squares of a piece.  But in Rosy Retrospection there is also a Hold piece... and it is only able to display three squares.

One of them, the cross shape (like a plus +), stood out in particular.  This mod, called &#34;[b]Tetris - Cross[/b]&#34;, was an attempt to be able to actually make a fun game using that cross shape by having other, simpler, pieces compliment it and make the gameplay work.  Two of the other rejected tricky &#34;Quintris&#34; shapes (the W and the U) are then also thrown into the mix.\n\nIt ends up being pretty interesting and fun.  Though, since it is using those challenging shapes, it might be easier for some players to play it on the Rosy mod since then the &#34;hold&#34; piece feature could be used.\n\nJust like in &#34;Quintris&#34;, completing an actual [i]Tetris[/i] (clearing 4 lines at once) is still the maximum number of lines cleared. This is because the engine is not expecting 5 lines cleared at once.\n\nAlso just like in &#34;Quintris&#34;, the “Next Piece” preview window itself does not want to display pieces made out of more than 4 blocks... To account for this, the pieces are orientated in a way that should still allow the player to infer which one is next easily.\n\nAll game modes, even 2 player, have been tested.\n\nThis mod is for the more common 1.1 version of Gameboy Tetris.\n\n----\n\nThere are 2 additional patches for converting other mods to &#34;Tetris - Cross&#34;.\n\n“[b]Tetris - Cross - Rosy Retrospection[/b]” is specifically for [url=https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/5813/]Ospin&#39;s awesome mod[/url].

That routine was failing during pause because it is not expecting the Quintris piece shapes. So pause was simply disabled, which makes everything still work perfectly. You should still be able to pause using whatever device you are playing this on, except for original hardware.\n\nAlso, like for regular &#34;Tetris - Cross&#34;, the Next Piece preview window only displays 4 squares of a piece.

This was an excellent project for learning the ropes of Game Boy debugging, with the goal to contribute more to the colorization of DMG-only releases.\n\nWith that said, it couldn’t have done it without the assistance of Xenophile, Specialagentape, and MojoDodo.

However, on a fresh save of the game, the player cannot access this screen\nuntil they obtain one of the game&#39;s endings and reset. \n\nThe game preforms several checks where it reads a value stored at D512. Some of these checks are related to the aforementioned level select. If the value at D512 reads 1 or greater, then the game&#39;s level select is made available. This patch (in a rather hacky fashion) forces the checks related to level select (at offsets 868DE, 868EA, and 9CADA) to read a different value, forcing level select to be made available on a fresh or incomplete save. \n\nIf the player is using a completely fresh save that has not yet beaten Chapter 1, Story 1, then the level select screen will not appear until that has been\nbeaten. \n\nAs a bonus, an additional check at 4037 has been modified to allow cutscenes to be skipped.

This check also reads the value at D512, and if it reads 1 or greater, sets a shorter\nwait timer for the alternative level end to Chapter 1, Story 1.

(Press down when you hit start on the Player Select screen).\n\n\nNote:  The “Next Piece” preview window cannot handle displaying pieces made out of more than 3 blocks, seemingly because of a max sprites on screen issue.

That routine was failing during pause because it is not expecting these different piece shapes.  So pause was simply disabled, which makes Hold and everything else still work perfectly.  You should still be able to pause using whatever device you are playing this on, except for original hardware.\n\nAlso, like the Note above, the Next Piece preview window has max sprite issues.  But since Rosy Retrospection also has the shadow piece, the Next Piece and Hold Piece windows cannot handle any more sprites at all.  It is still quite easy to play.\n\nAdditionally, because of the way Rosy Retrospection calculates the score exponentially, score is basically not functional.  Because it thinks these Giant blocks are worth a massive amount of points you will almost always end the round with the maximum score of 999999.]\n\n\n&#34;[b]Tetris - Colossus - Classic Hard Drop[/b]&#34; is specifically for [url=https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/5125/]Ospin&#39;s Classic Hard Drop mod[/url].

Mega Man I ~ IV were all ports of the NES Mega Man games with slight changes, but Mega Man V was entirely original, with a new Mega Buster (called Mega Arm), bosses, and story.  And it was great.\n\nSadly, the game had some flaws, such as having boss weaknesses all over the place, boss rooms being too boring, the final stage bosses being too easy, etc.  See the attached document for more detail.  In any case, this patch does the following:\n- Distributes the bosses&#39; weapon defense more evenly (including Tango) in order to increase the usefulness and availability of the weapons against their specific bosses -- not just in damage, but in practical usage sense.  Some are very effective, and some are semi-effective.  Generally, any given boss is weak to one weapon from the first 4 bosses, and another from the later 4 bosses -- see the attached chart for more detail.\n- Makes the GB-unique-boss fights from the past Mega Man games more difficult by changing the rooms and the weapon defenses.  In addition, Enker can only be damaged by at least semi-charged Mega Arm (1 damage, CL works), and Quint takes 1 damage from all Mega Arm attacks, including the fully-charged Mega Arm.\n- Changes up the Mega Arm&#39;s effectiveness for the bosses that were supposed to be immune to the normal bullets.  Specifically, Uranus, Terra, Wily 3, and Sunstar can only be damaged by the fully-charged shot (1 damage for Sunstar, and 3 damage for the rest).  CL will fail.\n- Balances out some of the weapons.  Specifically, Rush Coil and Rush Jet can have up to 3 bullets on the screen (4 if Rush is not on the field, just like Tango), Grab Buster costs more energy and can only have up to 2 bullets on the screen (instead of 3), Salt Water costs less energy, Electric Shock lasts shorter time but costs less energy, and Spark Chaser doesn&#39;t do massive damage against Wily 3 and is ineffective against Sunstar (Sunstar is immune to everything except the fully-charged Mega Arm).\n- Changes some of the mid-boss and boss rooms to make the fights more exciting and difficult.  Specifically, initial Venus&#39;s room has waterfalls, initial Neptune&#39;s room has uneven ground, one of Pluto&#39;s mid-boss&#39;s room has spikes, and most of the Wily Star boss rooms (including the rematch rooms) have different structures.\n- Minor changes to the stages, items, and enemies (includes unused enemies).  In addition, the large life/weapon energy restores 8 units instead of 10 units (consistent with the large P-chip units).\n- Some of the crystals require methods other than Break Dash or Deep Digger to obtain -- namely, MH upgrade and Rush Jet.  You can get them all in one-go without having to replay the stage, if you start from Saturn.\n- Changes the prices of few shop items -- most notably Weapon Refill and Energy Balancer.\n\nIf anyone has any specific requests regarding the boss vulnerabilities, then let hmsong know.  He is open to suggestions and may be able to work out a solution.\n\n\n\nApplying Notes:\n\n- This is for Mega Man V US rom, but it&#39;s also compatible with marc_max&#39;s [url=https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/7413/]Mega Man World 5 DX[/url].

Many other major and minor changes have been made to create a new Pokemon Yellow experience. This project aims to provide a different way to enjoy Yellow while adding more variety to the game, all while staying mostly true to the Pokemon Generation 1 experience. This hack was created using the Pokemon Yellow disassembly as a base.\n\nNOTE: Some emulators (such as VisualBoyAdvance) have difficulty playing Cramorant&#39;s voice clips. If they sound too quiet, try using a different emulator. For desktops, I recommend mGBA or BGB. Using VisualBoyAdvance may also cause graphical glitches to occur.\n\nMain Features:\n\n- Journey through the region, beat Team Rocket, collect all badges, catch every Pokemon, and become the Champ with a Cramorant by your side!\n- Following Pikachu has been replaced with Following Cramorant! Every sprite, graphic, sound, and text associated with Pikachu has been changed to fit with Cramorant. Cramorant&#39;s movepool, experience growth, and stats are loosely based off of Pokemon Sword/Shield.\n- Pikachu&#39;s Beach minigame is now Cramorant&#39;s Beach! As long as Cramorant knows Surf, you can play it!\n- New exclusive battle move added for Cramorant.\n- Every Pokemon has had their movesets expanded! Many more moves can be learnt through level up and TM!\n- Many wild and Trainer Pokemon have had their levels raised slightly in an effort to provide more of a challenge.\n\nAdditional Features:\n\n- Extra Pokemon! Cramorant and 2 other Pokemon have been added which brings the total amount to 154!\n- Extra battles! A few additional trainers have been added.\n- Greater Pokemon trainer variety. Trainers now use a bigger selection of Pokemon. Many Pokemon never that never got a chance to shine in battle will get their moment!\n- Greater wild Pokemon variety. Many rare Pokemon can now be found in several locations, and Pokemon that couldn&#39;t previously be found in the wild are waiting to be encountered!\n- All 151+ Pokemon are obtainable in-game without the need for trading or glitches, and can be infinitely encountered!\n- Some move animations which involved rapid flashing have been toned down for those with photosensitivity.\n- Hold B at any time in the overworld to move faster while walking, surfing, or biking!\n- The Item Bag can be sorted by pressing Start while opened.\n- A few minor locations have been added for new events. Many maps have also received some touch-ups to look nicer, and a few have been altered to be less claustrophobic (like Cerulean and Fuschia City). Many of the CUT trees have been removed. A couple of new buildings also open up after you become champion!\n- Tons of additional hidden items! Search suspicious places for them.\n- Catch rates boosted. Every Pokemon is now slightly easier to catch, and some are even much easier!\n- More forgiving Safari Zone. The amount of steps allowed to take has been increased substantially! More Safari Balls are also given to the player and many Safari Zone Pokemon have also been made slightly easier to catch!\n- Additional flavor text has been added. Several background objects now have descriptive text associated with them, such as Red&#39;s bed or the windows in Vermilion Gym.\n- New Cramorant intro sequence. (Coded by Damien Doury.)\n- Some beta and unused content included! Unused music (like Giovanni&#39;s theme) as well as unused graphics and text have been added. A few music tracks have also been replaced by songs adapted from the Generation 2 games.\n- Various bug fixes. Many Generation 1 bugs were fixed in Yellow, while Cramorant Edition fixes a few more minor errors and quirks. Any bugs which provided a negative experience for the player have been fixed.\n- Super Game Boy compatible! Comes with its own set of color palettes and its own border!\n- Link Cable compatible with the base Generation 1 games. Note that minor issues occur if Pokemon from Cramorant Edition are traded to base Yellow, and vice-versa.\n\nFeatures adapted from other projects and tutorials (which can be found on Github):\n- Better game corner. Faster and more forgiving slots along with the ability to repeatedly buy coins. (Adapted from Pokemon PureRGB by Vortyne.)\n- Repels can now be used immediately after they expire like in the modern games. (Included from Pokemon PureRGB.)\n- A much better Itemfinder! It&#39;s now actually useful by pointing you in the direction of hidden items and giving feedback based on how close to them you are. (Included from Pokemon PureRGB.)\n- The left and right d-pad can now be used while shopping to decrease/increase the amount of items by 10. (Included from Pokemon PureRGB.)\n- The low health alarm now only beeps four times before stopping. No need to annoy the player with constant ringing. (Included from Pokemon PureRGB.)\n- Pokemon no longer waste turns after waking up from sleep and can attack that same turn! \n- Player now turns to face trainers when spotted by them like in other Pokemon games.\n- A move deleter and re-learner have been added which allow you to delete any Pokemon move (including HMs) and learn any moves they&#39;ve known previously!\n- Improved Exp.

Max Repels, Full Restores, Rare Candies are at each mart, and a Pocket PC and EXP share are available very early on. The game pushes evolution levels back and removes most final forms. You will not earn Stat EXP from battling, but vitamins will work.\n\nPokemon movesets are revised so that a wide variety of Pokemon can be used without being overpowered – for instance, Grimer is available in Union Cave, but does not have access to Sludge until after Bugsy; conversely, some movesets are buffed, like Supersonic going to Confuse Ray for Ledyba. Many baby Pokemon replace their adult forms, including Bonsly, Mime Jr, Wynaut, Mantyke, Happiny, and Munchlax (sorry Azurill), and the legendary beasts are replaced with Smoochum, Magby, and Elekid. Nearly every pokemon can hard counter at least one boss pokemon, and almost no pokemon can totally sweep a gym leader.\n\nMany TMs have their availability reduced - no game corner TMs or purchasable punches. Many TMs require beating a back-to-back battle; for instance, Rest and Sleep Talk require back-to-backs on Route 45.\n\nThe level curve for enemy trainers is raised starting after Falkner so that you will usually be facing teams that are similar in level. Back-to-back battles are on many Johto routes. The level curve for gym leaders in Kanto is raised so that you can feasibly stay under the level cap as you take on each gym leader. Gym trainers are completely optional in Kanto.\n\nKaren is now the Johto Champion. She is a better thematic fit and her team is less centralizing for the elite four. To make this a little easier, there is now TM51 Karate Chop. \n\nSome features from the Pokecrystal Disassembly are implemented, notably:\n·       Kurt makes balls instantly\n·       Enemies don’t have 25% miss chance for status moves\n·       Hold B to run\n·       Kurt’s balls work as intended\n·       Glacier Badge works on SpDef\n\nOther changes:\n·       Flash not required for any caves\n·      Coin case is in B1F Goldenrod Dept Store -- used to purchase tutor moves\n·       Berry trees give 24\n·       Jasmine has a female Steelix\n·       Weekday events happen every day\n·       Whirlpool not needed in Dragon’s Den\n·       Pokeflute not needed to wake Munchlax\n·       Bill’s house now gives you vitamins if you show the right pokemon\n·       The Super Rod is in Blackthorn\n·       All flee mons now only rarely flee instead of sometimes flee: magnemite, grimer, eevee, porygon, dratini, unown, snubbull, phanpy, teddiursa, delibird, cubone.\n·       Secret boss in the Viridian basement\n·       Easter egg – how did the moon ball work in the original game?\n\nCredits:\n·       Pokecrystal disassembly team\n·       Rangi42, Polished Map\n·       Rangi42, Icons for Elekid, Magby, Tyranitar\n·       PiaCRT, disassembly and spriting debug\n·       Luna, spriting debug\n·       SCMidna, Munchlax sprite\n·       Wynaut sprite [https://www.deviantart.com/ericgl1996/art/SpaceWorld-97-Wobbuffet-and-GSC-Wynaut-863832924]\n·       Sharkguy on spritersresource.com  for Bonsly, Mime Jr, Happiny, Mantyke sprites (some back sprites are adapted Gen 4 assets)\n·       Ferropexola, events and sprites debug\n·       DerekAllenDean, events and sprites debug (playthrough at: https://youtu.be/kHgb2ZZNgtE)\n\nSee README file for full pokemon changes.", "reldate": "15 June 2023", "rominfo": "Database match: not found\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20210227-015730)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: BB61DF9A92BEDE80CD3DF5AD1E44697B933D010E\nFile/ROM CRC32: 10178FDA", "author": "dwg6m9", "filekey": "7868"}, "7351": {"title": "Tetris - Max Speed", "description": "[b]Tetris - Max Speed[/b] is a demonstration of the maximum speeds Nintendo could have used on Game Boy Tetris.

There are two characters to choose from: Red (Boy) and Green (Girl). If you chose the female character, the player character sprite is green (in the overworld, battle screen, town map screen, trainer card, etc). All references to the player character&#39;s gender in the games script have been gender neutralized (ie, Mom says &#34;all boys leave home&#34; to &#34;all kids leave home&#34;). The male character is red. The sprites for the girl character were made by BurstXShadowzX on DeviantArt and adapted into the rom.\n\nThis is built on the latest version of the Pokered-GBC rom. In addition to colorizing the rom, the Pokémon sprites have been replaced with their Gen 2 equivalents, back sprites expanded to 48x48 and the audio engine updated to Crystal&#39;s. \n\nA few other changes were made, listed below. The hack is now a &#34;catch &#39;em all&#34; hack, in that you can get all Pokémon in a single play through, including all version exclusives and trade-evolve Pokémon are available.\n\nThe game has been play tested through to the end four times. If you find any errors, especially with the coloration or Red or Green&#39;s sprites in-game, please leave a review stating where the issue is.\n\nSpecial thanks to Danny-E33. He provided much insight into the function of his colorization code and without him the hack would not have been possible. \n\nGameplay changes:\n-The chance to encounter Ekans on routes 4, 9 and 10 have been replaced with Sandshrew. Ekans can still be found on other routes.\n-The chance to encounter Oddish on routes 12, 13, 14 and 15 have been replaced with Bellsprout. Oddish can still be found on other routes.\n-The chance to encounter Growlithe on routes 5 and 6 have been replaced with Vulpix. Growlithe can still be found in the Pokemansion.\n-Magmar has been added to the Pokemansion in the same way as he appears in Blue.\n-Pinsir has taken the place of Syther as a prize at the casino. Syther is still available in the Safari Zone.\n-Casino Pokémon prices have been adjusted.

Unlike Zelda though, all battles are one-on-one fights, and all enemies drop one specific item.  It&#39;s a decent lightweight game.\n\nIn the original game, you could technically clear the game very quickly, because you can skip most fights and very little exploration was necessary (most key items were conveniently placed).  Also, the items you can get before the second boss (including the hidden items) were rather pathetic, which was one of the reasons that made the second boss fight very difficult.  And the third boss and on were quite easy, because the Homing Bomb was so overpowered.\n\nSo this patch switches the items around to better balance things:\n- More fights and explorations are necessary to get the key items.\n- Numerous mid-tier items can be found earlier (although difficult to obtain).\n- Some top-tier items are either less conveniently placed or moved to later stages.\n\nNote: Yes, it is indeed possible to solve Zone 3&#39;s bomb puzzle without the Remote Control.  Two ways, in fact.  And one of them doesn&#39;t even require any Fire upgrade.  No more cheesing through that puzzle.

This ensures an authentic gen 2 experience, while bringing the game to it&#39;s full potential.\n\nFeatures Include\n- Dynamic Gym Leader level scaling for &#39;non linear&#39; part of Johto. The team&#39;s and levels of Chuck, Pryce and Jasmine scale to whether you have 5, 6, or 7 badges.\n- Gym Leader teams optimized. Leaders see more Gen 2 representation, while still retaining their original aces (e.g. Bugsy keeps his Scyther, but Metapod and Kakuna are replaced with Pineco and Ledian). Movepools see increasing diversity and complexity. Gym Leaders use held items.\n- Improved level curve. Gym leaders and trainers no longer fall off in the late mid-game, only to spike in the Elite Fuur. The game now sees a more linear rise in leveling, with expanding trainer teams to provide more EXP. Players who don&#39;t grind will still be under leveled to the champion, but this is intentional and typical for most Pokémon games.\n- Pokémon availability increased. Kanto locked Gen 2 mons like Houndour added to Johto. Route encounters have been diversified. Gen 1 trade mons evolve by level up. Gen 2 trade items now simply work like evolution stones. Increased accessibility to evo items. Fossils + GS Ball added to Ruins of Alph. All legendaries are now catchable.\n- Gameplay Balancing. Dark-type is now Physical while Ghost is Special. DRASTIC improvements to Pokémon movepools. Balancing to actual moves (notably large improvements to bug and fighting type). Weak single evo mons + other underperformers have seen some stat buffs (i.e Misdrievus is now closer stat wise to Mismagius, but not on par).\n- Item Improvements. Flower shop now sells Berries. Cianwood pharmacy sells Stones &#38; Ethers. Post radio tower Mahogany mart sells Upgrade and Metal Coat. Mahogany, Blackthorn, and Celadon now sell TMs. X Items cannot be purchased.\n- Storyline enhancements. Slight adjustments to timing of Silver&#39;s character arc. A man helps Lance uncover the Rocket Hideout. Team Rocket has seen Executives named as Archer and Ariana. &#39;Hyuck-Hyuck&#39; Rocket now has a small character arc.

Gym leader teams have competitively set teams of 6. Upon beating them, you must rematch the Elite Four for title of Kanto Champion before facing Red. Consider this section a &#39;challenge&#39; post game.\n- Fight the creator (Smith), production manager (Craig) and video editor (Weebra) in the Trainer House.\n\nWhat Stays the Same\n- No Physical/Special split\n- All Pokémon keep their typing\n- No new Pokémon added\n- No new trainers added\n- Badge boost remains\n- Trainer AI is untouched\n- TMs are single use (all TMs eventually become available for purchase)\n- Most original wild encounters remain where they were, outside of some overly redundant ones\n- All storyline outcomes are the same, although some get to their conclusion slightly differently", "reldate": "03 December 2023", "rominfo": "Database match: Pokemon - Crystal Version (USA, Europe) (Rev 1)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20210227-015730)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: F2F52230B536214EF7C9924F483392993E226CFB\nFile/ROM CRC32: 3358E30A", "author": "TheSmithPlays", "filekey": "8134"}, "7582": {"title": "Good Underwater Patches", "description": "Did you ever have a chip on your shoulder about the underwater sections from The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages for the Game Boy Color? \n\n[i]Well, now that mess is solved![/i]\n\n\n\nTwo different patches that fixes the infamous underwater waves and swimming controls.\n\nYou can apply these patches at any point in your quest so do not worry about breaking your save!\n\n\n\n[b]GOOD SWIMMING[/b] = \nYou can swim with the Mermaid Suit using regular movement now without having to tap the d-pad each time\n\n\n[b]NO WATER WAVES[/b] = \nWhen underwater with the Mermaid Suit, there will no longer be the wavy underwater line effect on screen anywhere", "reldate": "12 September 2023", "rominfo": "Database match: Legend of Zelda, The - Oracle of Ages (USA, Australia)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20210227-015730)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: 880374FB978B18AF4AA529E2E32F7FFB4D7DD2F4\nFile/ROM CRC32: 3800A387", "author": "CousinCatnip", "filekey": "8135"}, "7598": {"title": "Revelations: Last Bible", "description": "A graphical hack of Revelations The Demon Slayer where the graphics are reverted back into the ones from Megami Tensei: Last Bible.

Used in Japanese media to denote a remastering, updated retelling , or a &#34;true form&#34; of something.[/I]\n\nStarted in 2018 by a secret cabal of ancient Pokemon nerds, Shin Pokemon is an enhancement ROM hack of Pokemon Red &#38; Blue that aims to be the ultimate remaster fans never got. It is a mostly-vanilla hack that focuses on fixing game engine bugs and oversights from the original game. Additionally, trainer AI routines are improved and multiple quality-of-life enhancements have been added. It also acts as a kind of research-informed speculative work that interprets what the 2016 Nintendo Virtual Console re-release of Gen-1 Pokemon could have been. It is the image of a glitch-free experience with player-friendly goodies and enhancements common to other modern remasterings.\n\nSee the Red and Green versions also on RHDN:\n\n[URL]https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/8087/[/URL]\n\n[URL]https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/8189/[/URL]\n\n\n[B]#Summary[/B]\n\n[B]Lite features for a cleaned-up purist experience[/B]\n[QUOTE]\nOver 200 bugs, glitches, oversights, and text errors of all sorts have been fixed! \nThere are too many to enumerate in a simple summary, and some of them are very obscure or previously undiscovered.\n\nIncludes an english build of Blue-JP version.\nIt swaps prizes, trades, wild encounter data, and some text to replicate the original japanese release.\nIt also has all the pokedex data in metric.\n\nEngine features from USA Yellow version have been backported.\nNo more duochrome!

It wasn’t realised at first, that it&#39;s not just Pokémon sprites that are compressed. After learning this, the project would require a download of the disassembly to continue making this hack, as the tool that was being used wasn’t sophisticated enough to get the job done. It didn’t take long to realise the potential here, so some decisions were made to add some new stuff to the game, although it felt like the current ideas at the time weren’t enough. After a long hiatus, information was stumbled upon by chance that there was a bunch of content that was only in the Japanese version of Pokémon Blue, and that’s when the vision for this hack was fully realised. \n\nThis hack aims to be what Pokémon Blue was in Japan. A ‘What if?’ third version of the generation 1 games (before they made Pokémon Yellow).\n\nIn terms of hacks go, this one’s pretty vanilla. But it was felt like the idea of replaying generation 1, but as a girl and with some minor tweaks here and there would be a cool idea to some people!\n\nOne more thing. [b]Missingno.[/b].  Sadly, because of these changes, [b]Missingno.[/b] no longer acts like it did in Red &#38; Blue, and acts more like its volatile counterpart in Pokémon Yellow. So tread with caution!\nIf in the future a fix is found for this, there will make an update!\n\n[1] Playing as a girl was made possible by 2 people.

Every trainer has a more varied and stronger line-up and all of the important opponents have custom movesets (many of which also use Hidden Power with an advantageous type), held items, better Pokemon and are at a higher level.\n\n- Lunatic Crystal has Level Caps that set you on equal terms with the bosses that are increased with each badge/met condition. At a certain level your Pokemon will no longer gain EXP, no matter what you do whether be it battling, using Rare Candies or using the Daycare. As an extra feature Pokemon also no longer gain EXP once they reach Level 100.\n\n- Every important trainer has had their DVs improved.\n\n- When defeated, the Player does not lose half of their money like usual, but rather a proportional amount depending on your highest level Pokemon and the number of badges the player has.\n\n- The Rival now has 3 seperate teams depending on your starter choice.\n\n- More opponents use healing items and those that already did have better ones available.\n\n- Stat EXP and all of the badge boosts have been removed. The 25% Status miss chance that the AI had is also gone. This makes fights more challenging and sets the player on equal footing with enemy trainers. Furthermore Vitamins (with the exception of PP UP) and X items have been removed.\n\n- The player is prohibited from using items in battle and the &#34;SET&#34; battle mode is enforced against important opponents.\n\n- The progression of the game has been made more linear, rather than open like the original Crystal to better help with the level curve. There are also changes to the Gym Leader order, Eusine&#39;s Cianwood City battle (and the Suicune event), as well as the Tin Tower section unlocked after clearing Radio Tower is now enforced. The game also features extra mandatory opponents. The Sprout Tower is also a mandatory location when the player visits Violet City for the first time and acts as the first, real challenge of the game as well as a check that prevents progression. Some Gym Leaders will also refuse to accept your challenge if you do not have the right amount of badges.\n\n- Team Rocket now longer has unnamed Executives, all the members present in HGSS (Proton, Petrel, Ariana and Archer and Ariana) are present in this hack. All of the Team Rocket members use the Team Rocket theme and all of them have a custom &#34;R&#34; battle transition. There is also an important returning character...\n\n- The player has the ability to rematch all 16 Gym Leaders, the Elite Four, Champion Lance, the Rival, Red, as well as many characters that were fought at some point in the playthrough, that includes the new Kanto characters. In total there are 30 Level 100 rematches for the player to take on. All of these rematches are unlocked (other than the E4 rematches which are unlocked after beating Blue) after beating Red, with one main exception.\n\n- Battles against important Kanto characters that were not in the original GSC have been added (ex. You can now battle Lorelei in Kanto). Furthermore, a &#34;Red-like&#34; character in Gold is now the opponent in Virdian City&#39;s Trainer House. Professor Oak also is able to be fought after meeting the right conditions.\n\n- Some trainers now have new, custom battle themes that were added into this hack.\n\n- Better encounter variety in Johto: you can now get every Johto Pokemon before unlocking Kanto and many Kanto Pokemon are now obtainable in Johto. The player can now also get fossils and revive them just like in Generation 1. Game Corner Pokemon have also been changed. Wild Pokemon have increased levels as well and you tend to find more evolved forms in the wild.\n\n- The player can now catch all 251 Pokemon. Every single legendary can be caught as an overworld encounter, with the exception of Raikou and Entei who are still roaming Pokemon.\n\n- Some in-game trades have been changed (for example you can now get a Rhyhorn in Violet City).\n\n- The Celebi event has been restored and functions in the same way as the Virtual Console releases.\n\n- Friendship and Trade evolutions have been removed, every Pokemon that evolves now does so by either level up or with the use of evolution stones. Evolution Stones are now purchasable in Goldenrod and Celadon, albeit at a higher price. Several Pokemon now also evolve at lower levels.\n\n- Improved level-up learnsets: the vast majority of Pokemon now have much better learnsets, with all moves being learned at lower levels. All evolution stages share the levels at which they learn moves, so the player no longer needs to delay evolutions and can enjoy a power boost right away. This does not apply to most stone evolutions (the exception being for example Eevee), however.\n\n- Improved TM/HM learnsets: Many Pokemon now have the ability to learn new TMs and HMs. TMs are now also reuseable, rather than one use. Pokemon can now freely forget HMs as well. A lot of TMs that normally would only be obtainable in Kanto, can now be found in Johto. TMs and HMs found or obtained in the overworld instantly display the name of the move, rather than just the number of the TM/HM.\n\n- This hack features two new Move Tutors in Cianwood City and Blackthorn City that teach the following moves: Thunder Wave, Reflect, Light Screen (Cianwood) and Rock Slide, Outrage and Submission (Blackthorn). The Goldenrod Move Tutor now appears after defeating Pryce, rather than beating the Elite Four. He can also be found on all days of the week, charges 500 coins rather than 4000 coins and does not dissapear after teaching one of your party members a new move.\n\n- Ecruteak City has a Move Relearner who can teach your Pokemon moves that they knew at lower levels at a cost of 500 Pokedollars.\n\n- Many moves have changed power, accuracy and type, as well as new effects in order to make them more viable and give player more varied options (For example Strength is now a Rock Type Move and Sky Attack functions in a similar way to Brave Bird).\n\n- Some Pokemon have increased stats and new secondary types in order to make them more viable (For example Ledian is now a Bug/Psychic type with +20 to its&#39; SpA).\n\n- Fourth Stat Page in which you can view the DVs of the Pokemon, as well as its&#39; Hidden Power type.\n\n- Many in-game rewards have been changed, for instance Mr. Pokemon&#39;s reward for bringing him the Red Scale is the TM for Hyper Beam.\n\n- The Cianwood Pharmacy now sells status curing Berries.\n\n- All Pokemon now have custom, colored menu icons. Badges that are viewed in the trainer card also have colour now.\n\n- Some characters such as Eusine get a new overworld sprite. Characters added to this hack also get an overworld sprite of their own.\n\n- The EXP system has been updated to match the one found in Generation 6, all battle participants obtain an equal amount of EXP and the EXP. Share now functions the same as it does in Gen 6 and is now a key item, instead of a held item. To further help with the grind, the player now can get more Rare Candies either in the overworld, or as rewards. Lucky Egg is also obtainable in Johto. Catching Pokemon also grants EXP, just like it does in Let&#39;s Go games for instance. The EXP Share is also obtained very early to make levelling much less tedious, the player receives it from Prof. Elm once they deal with the rival for the first time and get Pokeballs.\n\n- The mart in Indigo Plateau sells Rare Candies at the price of 10 after Blue has been defeated to take away the need for grinding for the final battles of the game.\n\n- Introduction of Repel as a togglable Key Item. The Repel is obtained after being shown around Cherrygrove by the Guide (which is now a mandatory scene) and it can be turned on and off at any moment and it acts as an infinite repellent. Because of this the regular Repels have been removed from the game since they serve no purpose. Also the Map Card is now obtained as soon as you get the Pokegear.\n\n- Pocket PC is a new key item that allows you to open the PC in the overworld at any time. It&#39;s obtained as soon as you get your starter Pokemon and it serves as a great tool to organize your party and check caught Pokemon as soon as you can, without the need to rush to the nearest PC. There is a limiation however, it cannot be used indoors, so you can&#39;t use in spots like Rocket Hideout, Radio Tower, Gyms or Indigo Plateau.\n\n- Bag expansion: Rather than having a limit of just 20 items, the bag can now fit up to 84 items.\n\n- Many QoL features: The ability to run by pressing B that also allows for fast surfing, removal of the save delay (that also helps with organizing boxes), a clock in the bottom left corner while the menu is open, Pokemon don&#39;t take damage in the overworld, faster healing in the Pokemon Center of the first heal, Kurt instantly making Pokeballs, among others.\n\nThe documents (Moveset changes, Stat and Type changes, Move changes, Mart changes, Encounter tables and all the Important Trainers and Rematches) can be found here:\n\nhttps://workupload.com/file/7hUFsUYDLye\n\nA massive thank you to everyone in the &#34;pret&#34; Discord, the Pokémon Crystal Disassembly, and the many tutorials you have written.

If anyone plays it and notices something off, whether a glitch, a typo, or just general feedback on taste, please comment! Enjoy!\n\nPOKEMON FEATURES:\n\n*Fully revamped stats, with BSTs given a general baseline of 400 for weakmons, 450 for mid-tier early mons, 500 for most mons, and slightly higher for starters and such. \n*Tweaked typings for many and vastly improved learnsets for all!\n*All evolutions available without trade, with Happiness replacing itemless trade evos and item evos replaced by just using item. All evolution items available before Elite Four, including a stone shop in Cianwood.\n*Happiness is easier to accrue.\n*Evolution levels tweaked for many mons with high requirements.\n*Female and Shiny Pokemon have different IV spreads instead of purely suboptimal ones. Gender ratios adjusted among starters.\n*Growth rates generally improved, with slow growth rates reserved only for truly powerful Pokemon.\n*Improved level curve for wild Pokemon, particularly in Kanto.\n*Barring legendaries and unpicked starters, full dex can be completed before Elite Four. Odd Egg from the Daycare now hatches a Kanto starter, so at least one can still be done! Additional starters available in Celadon Game Corner and by trades throughout Kanto.\n*Morning-exclusive mons now appear during the day as well.\n*Headbutt Trees are streamlined so that every mon-filled tree in a region offers the same Pokemon, rather than forcing a hunt through different trees.\n*Old Rod can now catch more than Magikarp semi-reliably, and fishing swarm locations offer rare chances for swarming mons outside of swarms.\n*Feraligatr&#39;s name is now Colossobek (Colossus+Sobek) because &#34;gatr&#34; is just awful. The Name Rater now changes all names, including traded mons, so change it right back if you miss it!\n\nMOVE FEATURES:\n\n*Dark is physical and Ghost and Poison are special to reflect the nature of their moves (of all three types, only Lick and Poison Sting are now in the &#34;wrong&#34; category as of Gen IV).\n*Overhaul of dozens of moves, including an accuracy buff to virtually every move with 70 BP or less.\n*Iron Head and Ominous Wind added to increase move options for Steel and Ghost, respectively.\n*Barrage, Egg Bomb, Nightmare, Spider Web, Whirlpool, and One-Hit KO moves removed.\n*Field moves such as HMs can be used by any mon that learns them as long as the physical TM/HM is in your possession. For instance, a Dragonite with Outrage/Wing Attack/Blizzard/Thunder can still use Fly, Strength, Surf, Waterfall and such in the field!\n*HM moves can be forgotten like any other move, no need for the Move Deleter.\n*All TMs can be repurchased, with new TM shops appearing as the game progresses. TM moves slightly shifted to improve learnsets (out with Sweet Scent, in with Rock Slide, for instance).\n*Move Reminder in Violet City teaches old moves for a modest fee.\n*Bill replaces Move Tutor outside of Game Corner and teaches Thunderbolt/Ice Beam/Flamethrower. He appears after Radio Tower rather than after Elite Four, and is no longer limited by day.\n\nTRAINER FEATURES:\n\n*Overhaul of virtually every trainer to provide a better level curve (not Kaizo difficulty, but in keeping with a full two-area game).\n*Improved Rival that steals both unchosen starters, because why would he not do this?\n*Improved Gym Leader rosters, with later leaders gaining Pokemon out of their selected type to counter said type&#39;s weaknesses.\n*Pryce now acts as the fourth gym, with Chuck/Jasmine/Morty acting as interchangeable 5/6/7; while their teams are not dynamic, the game nudges towards this order.\n*Rematches available for all Gym Leaders, with Johto Leaders giving bonus optional rematches before the Elite Four.\n\nSTORY FEATURES:\n\n*Deeper integration of Gym Leaders and Elite Four members outside of their gyms a la Platinum to create a sense of place in the world and offering small story beats in Kanto.\n*Suicune and Ruins of Alph quests are incorporated more deeply into the plot, with Karen replacing Eusine as our resident legendary hunter.\n*Rocket HQ in Mahogany now offers meaningful choice between ambush statues and trick floor, and Radio Tower is heavily streamlined (no backtracking, and a Nurse Joy in the second floor to keep things moving).\n*Completing Unown Dex and solving every Unown wall text puzzle in the Ruins of Alph earns you Legendary rewards!\n*Falkner&#39;s retired father replaces Bill&#39;s grandfather in Cerulean Cape, offering a quest that sees you find and (hopefully) capture Kanto&#39;s Legendary Birds.

Mega Man 1 ~ IV were all ports of the NES Mega Man games with slight changes, but Mega Man V was entirely original, with a new Mega Buster (called Mega Arm), bosses, and story.  And it was great.\n\nHowever, many of MMV&#39;s bosses were generally easier than the previous game bosses.  This was especially true for the past GB-exclusive bosses (Enker, Quint, Punk, Ballade) -- while it was nice to pay homage to the past GB games, all of them clearly got weaker, slower, and/or lacking some skills compared to their original selves, thus making most of the battles too easy (Enker and Quint were already easy to begin with).\n\nSo, this patch does the following to make the bosses more difficult (but still fair, imho):\n\n- Changes some boss rooms.  Specifically, initial Venus&#39;s room has waterfalls, initial Neptune&#39;s room has slightly uneven ground, most of the Wily Star boss rooms (including the rematch rooms) have different structures, and Sunstar&#39;s room has slightly more gravity (phase 1&#39;s laser duration was reduced to mitigate this).\n- Increases the power of many boss attacks, usually by 1.\n- Changes few bosses&#39; behaviors.  For example, Enker&#39;s big sword wave requires less hits to activate, Quint and Ballade have less &#34;stand-still&#34; time, and Terra&#39;s Spark Chaser has less &#34;stay-still&#34; time.\n- Changes the Mega Arm&#39;s effectiveness for some of the bosses.  Specifically, Uranus, Terra, Wily Brain 2, and Sunstar can only be damaged by the fully-charged shot (1 damage for Sunstar, 3 damage for the rest, and CL fails).  In addition, Enker can only be damaged by at least semi-charged shot, and Quint takes 1 damage from all Mega Arm attacks, including the fully-charged shot.\n- Reduces the damage Saturn and Uranus take from their major weaknesses to more reasonable level.  In addition, one of the major weaknesses from the bosses with multiple major weaknesses was changed to minor weaknesses (so that they would only have one major weaknesses, just like all other bosses).  Likewise, some of the minor weaknesses from the bosses with multiple minor weaknesses were removed (to either 1 damage or immunity).\n- Sunstar is immune to everything except the fully-charged Mega Arm.\n- Other minor changes, mostly due to the compatibility issues.\n\nBIG thanks goes to Nezz.  He helped hmsong in some difficult parts of the hacks.\n\nIf you have any new ideas (big or small), then let hmsong know.  He is open to them, and he may be able to work something out.\n\n\nApplying Notes:\n\n- There are 2 versions --  one for Mega Man V US rom, and one compatible with marc_max&#39;s  [url=https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/7413/]Mega Man World 5 DX[/url] (apply the MMW5DX patch first, then apply the &#34;Harder Bosses DX&#34; patch).\n- This is compatible with all of hmsong&#39;s MMV patches, unless otherwise noted.\n- Always apply the patch on a new ROM.  Do NOT patch the most recent version on top of an old version.  It may screw up things and cause unintended effects.\n\nIf you have any questions or find errors, please PM [url=http://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=82786]hmsong on Romhacking.net[/url] (click the name, then click the name next to &#34;Forum Account&#34;, then click &#34;Send PM&#34;).", "reldate": "15 July 2024", "rominfo": "Database match: Mega Man V (USA) (SGB Enhanced)\nDatabase: No-Intro: Game Boy/Color (v. 20210227-015730)\nFile/ROM SHA-1: 9A7DA0E4D3F49E4A0B94E85CD64E28A687D81260\nFile/ROM CRC32: 72E6D21D", "author": "hmsong", "filekey": "8741"}, "8175": {"title": "Mega Man World GBC (Translated to Brazilian Portuguese)", "description": "Full translation of the hack “Mega Man World: Dr. Wily&#39;s Revenge GBC” for Brazilian Portuguese, created after translating the original game.
